ENSURING ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PARTICIPATION 01
Since 2014 ,Yemen hasbeen facing atragic and extended political crisis that hasseverely impacted thecountry’s future .According
tothe United Nations, following sixyears ofwar, the country isgoing through the worst humanitarian crisis inthe world .In
December 2018 ,parties involved intheconflict agreed onaseries ofconfidence -building measures known asthe “Stockholm
Agreement”, under thecoordination oftheUNSpecial Envoy forYemen .One ofthemost striking observations ofthese talks was
thelack ofparticipation ofYemeni youth who represent 70%ofthepopulation .
Youth inYemen struggle tofind reliable sources ofinformation onthe peacebuilding process, which includes the ongoing
negotiations inacontext where independent media isunder attack .They also lack spaces tofreely share their perspectives onthe
kind ofsociety they aspire tolive in.Opportunities forexchange, participation, and dialogues onpeace among theyouth and
decision -makers areminimal .
InDecember 2019 ,UNESCO started implementing aproject
funded bytheUnited Nations Peacebuilding Fund (UNPBF) titled
“Empowering Yemeni youth towards peace :ensuring access to
information and participation .”The project aimed toreconnect
the Yemeni youth with the peacebuilding process, raise their
voices, make peacebuilding more inclusive and participatory,
foster the free flow ofinformation, and arrange two-way
communication between the main stakeholders and decision -
makers .The project, targeting fivegovernorates inYemen (Aden,
Hadhramaut, Hodeida, Sanaa and Taiz), sought tostrengthen
youth engagement through the use ofmedia, communication
and technology .This hasbeen done with theobjective toachieve
two primary targeted outcomes :
1. Improve access to information for youth on the
peacebuilding process, inorder toincrease their knowledge
and make informed decisions .
2. Provide Yemeni youth with safe spaces ofdialogue, which
includes the use ofsocial media, online surveys, youth
debates, and radio programmes ,toenable them tovoice
their needs and opinions with decision -makers and
duty bearers .
UNESCO partnered with RNW Media inimplementing this
intervention .RNW Media isaNetherland -based international
non-governmental organisation focusing on inclusion and
empowerment ofyouth through digital communities .
UNESCO and RNW Media have along -standing presence in
Yemen, based onanetwork built over the years through
activities and project implementation .Their engagement with
Yemeni youth isbased onregular feedback and interaction with
more than 200,000 young online users who follow RNW Media’s
Manasati 30platform .Manasati 30platform has itsown website
and ispresent ondifferent social media platforms, itmanages
the sixth -largest Facebook page inYemen, providing space of
free expression forthe youth inYemen and amplifying their
voices and opinions

Inorder fortheYemeni Youth tobeable toexpress themselves freely and inasecure and
welcoming environment, UNESCO and itspartners worked around different platforms, either
physical oronline, toprovide them with safe places toexchange .Whether through online
surveys (Yemeni Youth Barometer), debates, community radio programmes ,orthrough their
participation ininternational platforms, Yemeni youth were given the opportunity toshare
among themselves butalso with decision -makers their views and opinions .UNESCO strived toimprove access toinformation for Yemeni youth through building
capacities ofyoung Yemeni journalists toproduce content that ensures balanced coverage of
the peacebuilding process .The produced content necessitated the development ofan
information platform todisseminate messages tothe youth .Inaddition, the intervention
supported youth -led peacebuilding initiatives through the “My Solution” activity, further
promoting content creation fortheyouth and bytheyouth .Capacity building

ENSURING ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PARTICIPATION 01
UNESCO organised aseries oftraining targeting young Yemeni journalists toreinforce their
capacities and ensure abalanced and unbiased coverage ofthe situation inYemen .Young
journalists were trained onprofessional peacebuilding reporting, conflict -sensitive coverage and
fact-checked content .Trainings followed aparticipatory and inclusive methodology that
delivered knowledge, emphasised skill development and focused onforming attitudes .
ATraining ofTrainers onPeace Journalism, facilitated byMedia Association forPeace (MAP), was
organized with theaim tocreate apool ofwell-trained journalists able toshare theknowledge
acquired with their peers .The top trainees were invited tolead onthe ground training
coordinated byRNW Media tobroaden thereach ofthis activity .
Based ontheresults ofthis first capacity building activity, five additional training courses were
organized corresponding totheneeds expressed byyoung Yemeni journalists .MAP organized
anadditional training onInternational Humanitarian Law and Human rights, while AlJazeera
Media Institute (AJMI) facilitated four training events onDigital Journalism, Media Outlet
Management, Safety ofJournalists and Reporting onGender -based Violence .
The project trained 135 journalists, half ofthem women, who were able tocreate content and
bepublished onvarious platforms during theproject .
Intotal, 14initiatives were selected, representing five governorates of
Yemen covered bytheproject .During this activity and with thesupport of
the project, they were able tobroaden their outreach and deepen their
work, byorganizing specific activities inrelation with their area ofinterest .
While some peacebuilders organized awareness raising campaigns, others
focused on training, live events, debates, the creation ofsocial
experiments orthe production offilms and motion graphics videos .
Successful online campaigns were led through social media, engaging
thousands ofpeople .Each solution had theopportunity tobeshowcased
through adedicated video presenting their work, produced by
Manasati 30.Videos produced under this activity recorded more than
445,000 views, inspiring many other young people totake upsimilar
initiatives .Capacity building

Building an information 
platform: Road to Peace
Through “My Solution”, theproject supported and showcased success stories ofyoung Yemeni peacebuilders who
engaged local communities inpeacebuilding activities .This called onapplicants toprovide their solution to
peacebuilding problems inYemen towin the Peacebuilders Award .Selected winners were supported forthree
months tolaunch their activity, document results, create avideo, and promote their activities through the
Manasati 30platform website and social media channels .1.1
1.2My Solution –Peace 
Builders initiatives
1.3The intervention supported the development ofa
dedicated webpage titled “Road toPeace ”,hosted and
managed by the Manasati 30 website .The page is
dedicated tosharing peacebuilding content inYemen and
works toamplify youth voices and opinions .The platform
and itssocial media outlets currently have over 260,000
followers, and their creative content has over 4.8million
views onFacebook .
Over 158 pieces ofdiverse and high -quality content are
published by108 young journalists supported bythe
project ontheManasati 30’sFacebook page and “Road to
Peace website” (more than 65,000 page views) .According
toasurvey ledonthe Manasati 30website, 92%ofthe
participants confirmed that their understanding ofthe
peacebuilding process has improved, demonstrating that
the published material issupporting communication of
information about the peace -building inYemen and
contributing tobetter inform theyouth .

Community Radio 
ProgrammesAfter online survey and debates, community radio provides avery good platform to
access information with abroad local reach and agood engagement .
UNESCO cooperated with Community Media Network (CMN) to oversee the
implementation and broadcasting of210 Radio programmes byfivelocal radio stations
inAden, Hadramout, Mahrah ,Mareb ,and Shabwa governorates toempower community
radio stations inYemen toproduce and broadcast content related tothepeacebuilding
process fortheyouth and bytheyouth .Each radio paid aparticular attention towomen
and youth inclusion intheir programs toensure representation .
344 young people (47%women) participated intheradio programmes .Toenhance a
two way communication, decision -makers and government officials were invited as
guests insome programmes .Tobroaden thereach ofthedifferent programs and ensure
access toinformation, the content was uploaded on online platforms such as
SoundCloud orYouTube .
9CREATING SAFE PLACES FOR DIALOGUE
Inorder fortheYemeni Youth tobeable toexpress themselves freely and inasecure and welcoming environment,
UNESCO and itspartners worked around different platforms, either physical oronline, toprovide them with safe
places toexchange .Whether through online surveys (Yemeni Youth Barometer), debates, community radio

ENSURING ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PARTICIPATION 01
2.3
Yemeni Youth 
Barometer
2.1Offering afirst space fordialogue, the project invited the Yemeni youth toexpress
themselves through aseries of6online surveys related topeace inYemen, launched on
Manasati 30website .
The surveys, known astheYemeni Youth Barometer, aimed tounderstand Yemeni youth
priorities, needs and aspirations .They were completed bysocial media listening projects,
providing more insight and data oneach subject covered .
Survey analysis and social listening findings were shared online through Manasati 30as
well ascompiled into reporting booklets that were shared online and with the main
stakeholders and decision makers, amplifying theyouth voice and supporting them in
sharing further their opinions and discussing alternatives .
2.2
Debate 
ActivityDebates provide aformidable platform fordiscussion and exchange inanopen minded
and tolerant environment, providing thedebaters with theability toexpress themselves
inanargumentative way and confront their ideas tonew ones, allowing them todevelop
and enrich their thoughts .
This tool was used intheproject asaway foryoung Yemenis todiscuss and confront
their vision about peace building inYemen .One national and four regional debates were
organized throughout theproject, engaging over 650 Yemeni young men and women .
The presence oflocal decision -makers inthose public debates, designed and organised
byyouth -led organisations ,contributed tofoster intellectual dialogue and two-way
communication .
Toprepare theparticipants and give them thekeys topresent, explain and argue their
position, adebate toolkit was developed through aworkgroup ledbyaregional expert,
and trainings were organized tointroduce and build theskills oftheyouth ontheartof
debating .
The project supported online participation ofyoung Yemeni voices inUNESCO ledevents,
such astheMedia and Information Literacy Arab Regional Conference and theRegional
Arab Panel, part oftheglobal World Press Freedom Day celebration hosted inNamibia in
May 2021 .
Those events offered avenue foryoung Yemenis tobespeakers ininternational panels,
discussing hate speech, media freedom and the information disorder during
COVID 19.While raising awareness about the situation ofYemen, itallowed the
Yemeni youth toraise their concern and made their voice heard ataglobal level . 2.4 Strategic 
Outreach 
Activities
101.The project topic, peacebuilding, isinherently sensitive inacountry
where war has been raging forseven years, and media and public
opinions are polarised .The project adopted aneutral, balanced and
fact-checked approach, focusing ontheneeds and aspirations ofyouth
and women, which worked well intheYemen context .
2.With the onset ofCOVID -19,acertain number ofon-the-ground
activities were threatened and had tobemodified toensure health
and safety .The project could adapt quickly tothenew conditions by
moving some implementation toonline modalities
3.While online modalities have proven successful, they were generally
more time -consuming .Future interventions canbenefit from providing
time and resources forusers toget familiar with the technology .
Mitigation measures areneeded totackle theslow internet services in
Yemen .
4.Some ofthesignificant challenges asinformed byproject experience :
a.Proper planning iscritical to the success of interactive,
multistakeholder and multi -activity programmes .
b.Additional time and resources are needed to maintain
communication, coordination and follow -up with various
stakeholders .The use of online mobile applications to
communicate, rather than official email channels, has proven tobe
very efficient inthe case ofYemen, where internet access isnot
always stable .
c.Local authorities and community leaders must beincluded inthe
initiative and take part inthediscussion channels tocontribute to
project implementation success .
5.The use ofsocial media toengage youth inthis project and reconnect
them with thepeacebuilding process has proven tobesuccessful and
critical totheinitiative’s success .Social media offered anew platform
foryoung people’s freedom ofexpression .
6.Developing ayouth -focused and gender -sensitive content strategy
tosupport the discussion was essential toensure participation and

Youth need more education and skill development toengage
online and take upinitiatives .Online training isbecoming a
sound alternative for project implementation, team
collaboration and dissemination ofinformation, which should
beexploited, also inthearea ofpeacebuilding .
Atthesame time, much work needs tobedone toimprove
these online platforms .New technologies can befurther
leveraged tocreate more opportunities and play asignificant
role inshaping future interventions .
The online modality requires alotofcommunication with
more meetings tocreate links and connections and maximise
the information -sharing potential .Online activities have tobe
given more commitment and further engagement toensure the
inclusion and participation ofall.Anetwork oftrained journalists should becreated tofurther
support thecreation ofaneutral peacebuilding narrative .

ENSURING ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PARTICIPATION 01
The intervention hasbeen acatalyst foryouth and women toengage and become agents ofchange forabetter, safe
and peaceful Yemen .This project has introduced new narratives forpeace among Yemeni youth .After the
intervention implemented itsactivities and achieved itsoutputs with positive results that exceeded settargets, the
overall objectives can beassessed asachieved .Project outcomes have been reached when youth and women can
engage inpeacebuilding .The intervention has come toanend, but the youth’s new competencies, programmes ,
initiatives and ideas willremain inthefuture .THE WAY FORWARD:
EXIT STRATEGY AND SUSTAINABILITY
““This project represented atimely opportunity toensure that young people inYemen
aregiven aplatform and thenecessary support tobeinformed, actively participate,
understand, reflect and contribute tothepromotion ofdialogue and peace inYemen .”
Anna Paolini , UNESCO Representative for GCC and Yemen “
The following project results areexpected topersist :
1. Trained journalists now have theknowledge and skills tocreate balanced media content .
2. The Road toPeace page willcontinue tobeasource ofinformation fortheYemeni youth tolearn about the
peace process .Manasati 30has benefited from this intervention, and the platform will continue tofocus on
youth inclusion and gender equality .
3. Barometer and survey findings, social media engagement and analysis remain essential documentation for
future research and peacebuilding efforts .
4. Based onthe project’s success, “Mansatk Talk” debates ,anew programme under Manasati 30,devised
protocols ofdebates and willestablish adebating programme with standard guidelines .Itwillcontinue togive a
space fortheYemeni youth tovoice their aspirations and continue toexpress themselves .
5. My Solution Peacebuilder Awardees are grassroots civil society organisations with online and offline
communities advocating forpeace and prosperity .They areraising awareness, calling forinclusion, engagement,
and equality .Some initiatives have already signed cooperation agreements tocreate more content forpeace,
such astheDakkah initiative .
6. Atleast one radio station ,Tawasool Radio, has already decided tocontinue broadcasting theprogramme after
theend oftheproject .The management found theprogramme valuable tothepublic, while listeners found it
attractive .
7. Trainees oftheproject have gained knowledge and skills that willcontinue tobeused intheir future endeavours .
Many young people have benefited from engagement with the project, with results including values of
professional journalism, peacebuilding, inclusion and equality .Background 0214EMPOWERING YEMENI YOUTH TOWARDS PEACE 
ENSURING ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PARTICIPATION 02
After seven years ofwar, Yemen isfacing adevastating economic
crisis marked bythelack ofpublic services, livelihood opportunities
and increasing costs ofliving .The country, which isdependent onoil
revenues and depends onimport for90%ofitsfood, was shocked
byaprotracted armed conflict that has ledtothe suspension of
public salaries, unemployment and shortages offood, water and
medical supplies .The war impeded access tocritical services such as
education, health and energy .Before the crisis, the already failed
state faced security and stability challenges exacerbated byahealth
care crisis and COVID -19.UN reports highlight that 80%ofthe
population needs urgent humanitarian assistance and isattheedge
offamine .Yemen Context
The UN Special Envoy leads the peacebuilding effort inYemen,
supported bythe international community, with aseries ofpeace
talks working onreaching apositive conclusion tothe conflict .
Following theStockholm and Riyadh agreements between Yemen’s
conflicting parties, considerable reduction ofairstrikes and de-
escalation initiatives combined with military drawdown and back -
channel negotiations opened hope forfurther peacebuilding efforts .
The current peacebuilding effort atthelocal level issupported bythe
European Union, UNWomen, UNESCO, UNFPA, GIZ, among others .
Implemented projects leverage participatory and inclusive
approaches tosupport dialogue, coexistence and inclusion .Efforts
include consultations, surveys and research, interactive data
visualisation ,social media engagement, support tocivil society
organisations ,youth initiatives, gender inclusion, media and
research institutions .Peace -building EffortBackground 
The social sphere reflects thepolitical division with increased inequality, displacement and violence .Yemen’s media
landscape has been further polarized, representing the views ofdifferent conflicting parties and with very few
independent information platforms .
15EMPOWERING YEMENI YOUTH TOWARDS PEACE 
ENSURING ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PARTICIPATION 02
InDecember 2018 ,parties involved intheconflict agreed onaseries ofconfidence -building measures
known asthe“Stockholm Agreement”, under thecoordination oftheUNSpecial Envoy forYemen .One of
themost striking observations ofthese talks was thelack ofparticipation ofYemeni youth who represent
70%ofthe population .For asuccessful recovery, youth need peer support, collaboration and
empowerment tofoster mutual understanding and collaboration .Unfortunately, young people with the
energy toshape their future lack theskills, resources and opportunities toengage inpeacebuilding .
The project was needed toprovide youth with the skills and resources toengage inpositive
collaboration, acceptance and inclusion, teamwork and negotiation, responsibility and accountability .
The youth inYemen struggle tofind reliable sources ofinformation onthe peacebuilding process,
including theongoing negotiations inacontext where independent media areunder attack .They also
lack spaces tofreely share their perspectives onthekind ofsociety they aspire tolivein.Opportunities
foryouth toexchange views and participate inadialogue with decision -makers about the political
landscape and thepeacebuilding process areminimal .Project Needs
Social media isanimportant social engagement tool foryouth exchange and inclusion .This project
sought tobuild anarrative toengage youth onissues that support thepeacebuilding process .The project
created quality content foryouth toengage with thepeacebuilding process, provided reliable information
based on unbiased facts for valid discussions and allowed for free expression ofopinions
tobeproperly analysed and presented .Social Engagement

Project description and overall 
performance 
The following sections describe theproject alignment with
Government and UNStrategic frameworks, aswell asthe
effective partnerships with RNW Media and Manasati 30
platform and theparticipatory project design process, that
were the main factors contributing tothe success ofthe
project .
The project aimed tobuild uponthemomentum created
when confidence -building measures were agreed upon at
theYemen peace talks inDecember 2018 .The project was
timely and needed toreconnect young Yemenis with the
peacebuilding process by raising young
people ’svoices and fostering free flow of
information and two-way communication .
The project empowered youth with the skills, knowledge
and tools tocreate content and dialogue tosupport
peacebuilding .Itcombined online access toinformation
and media development tobecome Yemen ’sfirst youth -led
and youth -focused peacebuilding initiative .The project
provided aspace forpresent -day opinions and concerns of
youth onpeacebuilding .That space amplified freedom of
expression and young people ’sopinions, visions and
aspirations were shared with decision -makers, duty
bearers and peace brokers .
18EMPOWERING YEMENI YOUTH TOWARDS PEACE 
ENSURING ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PARTICIPATION 03
Project alignment with existing Governmental and UN Strategic frameworks
The Stockholm agreement insisted onbuilding youth engagement inpeacebuilding . 1
The project isalso aligned with theUNStrategic Framework forYemen 2017 -2019 ,which
recognises that “Peace and security inYemen arestrengthened with anemphasis onthe
effective leadership, participation and engagement ofwomen, youth and civil society .”2
The project isaligned with SDG 16:Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions, SDG 5:Gender
Equality, SDG 10:Reduced Inequality, SDG 17:Partnerships forthegoals . 3
The project contributed toseveral recommendations made during the 2019 cycle ofthe
Universal Periodic Review ofHuman Rights forYemen . 4
The proposed methodology isinline with the UNStrategy and Plan ofAction onHate
Speech, UN Plan ofAction onthe Safety ofJournalists, and the Issue ofImpunity,
spearheaded byUNESCO .5
This intervention also supports UNResolution 2250 onYouth, Peace and Security .The resolution
recognises that “young people play animportant and positive role inthemaintenance and promotion
ofinternational peace and security” .Youth inYemen areexpected toplay apositive role, and this
intervention hassupported this effort .
Ifyouth living inconflict zones have nosayinthepromotion ofpeace, disillusion isanaked threat .
Instead ofbecoming courageous heroes who aidpeacebuilding and help societies recover from
conflict, young people arereduced tovictims ofaconflict that destroys thebest part oftheir lifeand
casts ashadow also over their future prospects toenjoy thefulluse oftheir abilities .Intheworst of
scenarios, youth being deprived ofopportunities inconflicts can turn tocriminals who thrive from
thechaos orbecome military entrepreneurs inwar zones .

However, young people’s role inpeacebuilding efforts isnot only about contributions tosigning theagreements
that can stop violence, but also involves engagement insocial change tobuild asociety based ontrust that
precludes new outbreaks ofviolence .Itiscrucially important inYemen that theprotracted armed conflict isnot
inherited bythegeneration inturn totake over thecountry .Shaping thepeacebuilding process inYemen based on
young people’s lived experiences and grassroots -level insights may bethebest chance thecountry has toforge a
lasting peace agreement .
The project isrelevant inresponse toYemen’s current crisis and political conflict .
Project activities responded tolocal contexts and addressed avital population
segment .Implementation focused on gender equality and youth inclusion .
Implementation ofactivities was effective, with results -based evaluation and clear
indicators .The project leveraged local NGOs and supported community initiatives
with high outreach and engagement .Project 
Performance
The project success can beattributed totwo main strategies used toachieve the
objectives set.
Firstly, effective partnerships with RNW Media and Manasati 30engaged youth
inaneutral space advocating foryoung people’s needs and opportunities .
Secondly, the project design was developed through consultations with key
stakeholders .Workshops outcomes suggested interventions and initiatives that
informed project design .Success Factors
UNESCO has partnered with RNW Media forthe implementation ofthe project .
RNW Media istheformer Radio Netherlands Worldwide, which was founded asthe
Dutch international public broadcaster .RNW isnow amultimedia organisation
promoting free speech incountries where freedom ofexpression isrestricted .
RNW Media has along standing presence inYemen, implementing projects with
media development organization and youth NGOs .The Netherlands based
organization supported the development ofManasati 30,former Yemen Youth
Platform, which was founded asafree space foryouth toengage online .Being
now independent with itsown website and social media channels, Manasati 30
beneficiates from abroad reach inYemen, being thesixth -largest Facebook page
inthecountry with over 260,000 followersRNW Media 
Partnership and 
the Manasati30 
platform
Peacebuilding and media interventions required acareful project design toachieve
objectives, while prioritising thedo-no-harm principle .This project leveraged past
events, consultations, meetings, and workshops todesign itsactivities .
Anearly consultation with CSO and journalists was conducted toinform the
content development and barometer components .The research investigated
participants’ (a) knowledge and sources ofinformation related to the
peacebuilding process and peace talks, (b)needs interms ofinformation supply,
(c)aspirations and visions .The online research engaged 47journalists (38surveys
and nine semi -structured interviews) and 113 young Yemenis (93surveys and 20
semi -structured interviews) toensure full inclusion ofthe target inallfive
governorates and overcome internet challenges .
RNW Media held design workshops inApril 2019 with adiverse group ofYemeni
youth and civil society organisations from theNorth and theSouth ofYemen to
discuss priority areas tostrengthen inclusion and participation ofyouth inthe
peacebuilding process .Youth and civil society organisations developed aproblem
tree and asolution tree.Increased access toinformation, awareness -raising on
young people’s political rights, capacity -building onpolitical leadership and more
opportunities for dialogue with decision -makers toshape the peacebuilding
process inYemen were some oftheurgent needs listed .Asanoutcome ofthese
workshops, aproject concept was developed todesign activities and plans .Project Design 
Process
20EMPOWERING YEMENI YOUTH TOWARDS PEACE 
ENSURING ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PARTICIPATION 03
The design workshops were also anopportunity for youth and civil society
organisations tomap potential project implementation risks .They discussed how
thegaps and weaknesses oftheongoing peacebuilding projects could betackled
and addressed through this new project .
InDecember 2018 ,UNESCO setupanewsroom during thepeace negotiations in
Sweden tosupport young Yemeni journalists inproviding balanced coverage ofthe
negotiations totheaudience back home .The newsroom was asuccess, with over
5,000 followers from Yemen within aweek and 80,000 views within amonth .The
newsroom covered multiple faces and voices ofthe peacebuilding process .
Journalists were able toreport ontopics such aswomen inclusion inpeacebuilding,
prisoner exchange, thesafety ofjournalists, reconciliation measures, and justice for
victims oftorture .The newsroom had access tohigh -level decision -makers,
advisers and diplomats .The newsroom generated intense interest levels inYemen
and opened perspectives not usually reported intraditional media .The event
highlighted relevant activities tosupport sustainable peace .
Asafollow -up,UNESCO asked journalists toevaluate their experience and identify
areas where improvement was needed .Among the recommendations was the
need todiversify contents distributed onsocial media, improve engagement with
audiences and integrate new journalists from marginalized media into the
newsroom .UNESCO also reviewed feedbacks from audiences, who commended
thejournalists ’work .Several followers urged thenewsroom tocontinue tooperate
asitrepresents arare opportunity forYemenis tofollow thenegotiations liveand
voice their needs and opinions with journalists .These recommendations were
considered and incorporated asaproject component related toaccess to
information .Project Design 
Process Contd.
While attending thepeace talks, UNESCO and RNW Media shared theresults ofthe
youth surveys onpeacebuilding with decision -makers from theopposite parties of
theconflict and duty bearers .Their responses were very positive, and discussions
with Yemeni NGOs, advisers totheSpecial Envoy, government representatives and
foreign ambassadors were held toformulate project ideas tostrengthen youth
engagement inthepeacebuilding process .Consultation with 
decision -makers 
and duty bearers
InSeptember 2019 ,UNESCO organised aconsultation meeting between the UN
Special Envoy forYemen and agroup ofyoung Yemeni journalists, filmmakers and
photographers from across thecountry, including Taiz, Aden, Hodeida, Hadramout,
Socotra, Ibb,Mareb and Sana’a .The discussion enabled anopen and critical
dialogue onthe status ofthe peacebuilding process .Participating youth felt
empowered toshare their aspirations with theSpecial Envoy toYemen directly .In
response, the Special Envoy acknowledged that youth were marginalized and
marked itasone ofhispriorities inthecoming months, starting with this type of
consultation meeting .Healso stressed theimportance ofyoung people’s inclusion .
Hewelcomed UNESCO’s role inopening communication channels with Yemeni
youth .Young people’s keyrecommendations and discussion points with theSpecial

Challenges 
hindering youth 
potentialFirstly, inacontext where independent media isunder attack, young Yemeni
women and men struggle tofind reliable, fact-checked and duly -sourced
information onthe peacebuilding process, including ongoing peace negotiations .
Polarised information, and too often disinformation and misinformation, means
youth cannot keep abreast ofdevelopments and need torely onpolitical messages
from either side oftheconflict tounderstand thestatus ofnegotiations .The media
landscape inYemen has historically been captured and manipulated bypolitical
agendas, aspolitical parties own most ofthe outlets .The ongoing conflict has
exacerbated this characteristic, with increased unfactual ,biased political messages
and hate speech appearing inthemedia .
This situation, inturn, has created anoverall communication vacuum that needs to
betackled toempower youth inYemen .Young people need tofeel asense of
urgency and ownership over thepeacebuilding process .This lack ofinformation is
significant foryoung women who, due tocultural sensitivities around the use of
technology, face more challenges than men inaccessing information .Inadigital
age, itisimportant toensure that key discussions about thefuture ofYemen are
explained toyoung women and men sothat they may understand their rights and
contribute aspotential solution providers .
Secondly, Yemeni youth lack spaces tofreely share their perspectives onthekind of
society they aspire tolive in.Opportunities for exchange, participation and
dialogues onpeace among youth and between youth and decision -makers are
minimal .Following the crackdown onNGOs and independent voices after the
escalation ofviolence in2015 ,and thesubsequent collapse oftheNational Dialogue
Conference, civic space fordebates shrunk considerably .With noseat atthe
negotiation table and despite repeated calls toensure a20%quota foryouth inall
government bodies, youth remain largely isolated from political dialogues .
Inadigital age and with theoutbreak oftheCOVID -19pandemic, social media has
proven tobeavery compelling tool tostimulate youth discussions online and
circumvent some ofthe existing restrictions and security threats ofoffline youth
activism and advocacy .Without jobs butwith thepossibility ofearning both aliving
and status with armed groups, young people often seelittle option buttoenlist in
them .Toaddress these issues and reach outtoatleast 200,000 youth inYemen,
the project attempted tobetter integrate the voices ofYemeni youth into the
ongoing peace negotiations and empower them asactors ofpositive change
inthe peacebuilding process through the use ofmedia, communication and
technology .Social Media as an 
innovative solution

The project risk mitigation plans focused onyouth and women .The project results highlighted impact around
engagement and participation ofyouth and gender equality .
The project’s logical framework focused onyouth inclusion and gender equality .Allproject outcomes and outputs
were carefully analysed toaddress those two components ofthepopulation .Project indicators were disaggregated
bygender, and many activities were only open toyouth applicants .Youth inclusion and Gender Equality 
Approach24EMPOWERING YEMENI YOUTH TOWARDS PEACE 
ENSURING ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PARTICIPATION 04
Inclusion and equality were demonstrated inallactivities .Allproject activities targeted applicants intheage
group 18to30years .The Manasati 30platform reflected thetarget youth population .Alltraining attempted to
have 50/50male and female participants .Generated contents and videos were gender -balanced and created by
youth and targeted youth ofboth genders .Surveys highlighted gender inclusion and equality .Radio programmes
targeted youth, and programme interviews included young males and females .Debates and other initiatives
were organised athigh -level peacebuilding dialogue, emphasising therole ofyouth and demonstrating gender
equality .The various content components ,such astheRoad toPeace page, were entirely produced byyoung
Yemenis .The project empowered young people tobuild ontheir needs and interests .
Moreover, theMySolution activity which encouraged civil society activists, both women and men, todevelop
peacebuilding activities and expand their initiatives, has showed high participation ofwomen -ledinitiatives (9
women -ledout of14).Giving space forwomen toreflect ontheir community needs ledtogender -focused
activities, such asHumans ofTaiz campaign which brought women success stories inpeacebuilding tospotlight .
The intervention rules ofengagement and risk mitigation continued towatch engagement rates .Additional
efforts were made toensure and encourage women ’sparticipation onsocial media platforms .The project used
SMART targeting ,moderation and audience segmentation tosolely target women inseveral ads, hoping to
increase outreach toand engagement ofwomen .
Women ’sengagement onproject social media channels stabilised at18%bythe end ofthis project ,which is
agood percentage level given thelowpercentage offemale social media users inYemen (15%)asperFacebook .
The project highlighted leading women and represented future female political influencers .Female political
science students, female social media activists, and young women were allowed tobuild uptheir public speaking
skills inanenvironment with minimal opportunities forwomen tobepolitically influential .
The online surveys, social listening research,
and online conversations continuously fedthe
project team with insights into young people’s
needs .The content team considered the
findings when developing new media stories
and visuals .They were shared with decision -
makers and key stakeholders .This user -
centred strategy ensured that all the
implemented activities demonstratively met
young people’s needs .The project also created personas, fictional
characters representing different users to
better understand users’ needs,
characteristics, and behaviours .This allowed
forthe creation ofcontent catering tothe
needs ofthe different types ofaudiences .
The page covered peacebuilding topics,
raised awareness about the political
landscape and peace negotiation and
provided anopen platform forparticipation
and engagement .Many reports created
were mainly gender -focused, featuring
female activists, peacebuilders, workers,
prisoners, displaced and marginalized
women .The exceptional rate ofwomen
stories intheRoad toPeace page isanatural
consequence oftargeting women writers
and journalists .

Challenges and mitigation strategies
The project was launched asthe COVID -19pandemic erupted .The project had totake several
mitigation strategies, including work from home and moving activities online .Some activities were
conducted offline with adherence toCOVID -19protocols .
The shift toonline modalities ensured theprinciple ofno-harm forstaff and beneficiaries .While
online modalities have proven successful inmitigating COVID -19and political sensitivity challenges,
they were generally more time -consuming .Internet connectivity was challenging inYemen forboth
beneficiaries and theproject team .The project implemented theresult -based framework with an
additional no-cost sixmonths extension granted and fully achieved expected results .
COVID -19 Response
The story ofSami and Labib isalso representative oftheadaptability and resilience oftheYouth facing this crisis .
With theCOVID -19outbreak, Sami and Labib decided toopen acotton factory tosupport theproduction offace
masks and later expanded their production tocotton clothing, employing over 45women and 15orphans .Such
initiatives support the local economy, empower the youth, and provide them with income -generating sources,
contributing toreducing unemployment and poverty rates .

videography .Dalia isadoctor inTaiz, providing care tofrontline injured aswell asreaching outtopatients suffering
from thewar inremote location .With theoutburst ofthepandemic, she quickly adapted tothenew circumstances
and dedicated herwork totreat COVID -19patients .

challenge, theproject was able toadapt and
take the opportunity tofurther showcase
youth initiatives inresponse tothe crisis
and their essential and positive impact on
society .The project featured youth -positive
stories responding tothe pandemic .One
example isthe success story ofa25-year -
oldengineer from Hadramout who invented
ahand -held watch that hehopes can be
used toprevent the further spread of
COVID -19.Henamed it“Corona cleaned” .The watch hasalaser detector and alerts the

showcasing resilience, creativity and innovation inYemen .While this
report cannot share allthestories, three ofthem arerecounted here .
Other stories canbefound onvarious links inthis report .
The project also allowed Radio Lana toinnovatively cover certain topics through angles that have notbeen explored
before .Forinstance, theradio highlighted theissue ofIDPchildren needing tohave theright toeducation and be
freed ofany discrimination due totheir origin .Integration ofchildren intheeducation systems and schools and
providing children with asafe environment were among theareas theradio focused on.
The project also allowed the participating radio stations, including Radio Lana, toestablish partnerships and
cooperate with one another incovering societal issues/ and problems that arenotonly related toone governorate
butinstead providing theperspectives and latitude oftheproblem inadifferent governorate, thereby promoting
social cohesion from the perspective ofone community feeling and relating tothe sufferings ofanother one.

radio stations and showcase humanitarian stories from different governorates .The audience reacted positively to
thecontent, and weseethat wewillcontinue these collaborations .”

This project, through itsprogrammes ,provided theopportunity forRadio Lana toallow youth tohave aspecialised
radio segment onpeacebuilding and provided them with platforms tovoice their opinions freely, aspace for
expression that isvery limited inYemen given therestrictions, both political and sectoral .
Among the benefits of our participation in this project was that we were able to provide the youth with a much -
needed platform to voice their opinions on important topics that directly impact them.”

Some of the significant challenges 
as informed by project experience:
60Lessons Learned and Recommendations
The project has demonstrated the importance ofsetting upand supporting platforms foryouth topresent their
voices and experiences and topartner with each other towork towards peace together .Creating safe online and
face-to-face spaces foryouth tolearn from each other, give and receive support, has been instrumental inbringing
young people atamore central place intheconflict resolution process .
Youth voices need tobeheard ontheir own terms, without expecting young people tosubscribe toentrenched
opinions and predetermined aims ofapeace process .
The project topic, peacebuilding, isinherently sensitive inacountry where war has been raging forseven years, and
media and public opinions arepolarised .The project hasachieved itssetoutcomes and succeeded inovercoming the
challenges posed bytheinherent topic sensitivity and thesudden onset oftheCOVID -19pandemic .Itwas able to
dosothrough the adoption ofaneutral, balanced and fact-checked approach, focused onthe needs and
aspirations ofyouth and women .09
The use ofsocial media toengage youth inthis project and reconnect them with thepeacebuilding process has
proven tobesuccessful and critical totheinitiative’s success .Social media offered anew platform foryoung
people’s freedom ofexpression .Itallowed them todiscuss important topics related totheir country and its
future, including with youth with different backgrounds and from different parts ofthecountry .They were also
able toexpress their needs and aspirations through creative visuals .EMPOWERING YEMENI YOUTH TOWARDS PEACE 
ENSURING ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PARTICIPATION
With the onset ofCOVID -19,acertain number ofon-the-ground activities
were threatened and had tobemodified toensure health and safety .The
project adapted quickly tothenew conditions bymoving implementation to
online modalities, and keeping some activities face-to-face, while ensuring
that allthe safety and health measures were taken into account and
adhered to.While online modalities have proven successful, they were
generally more time -consuming .Future interventions can benefit from
online modality with proper planning, leveraging technology tools, and
providing time and resources forusers togetfamiliar with thetechnology .In
addition, mitigation measures are needed totackle the slow internet
services inYemen .
Time isalways asignificant limitation tocompeting needs and expectations .Proper planning is
critical tothesuccess ofsuch interactive, multistakeholder and multi -activity programmes .

ENSURING ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PARTICIPATION
““Manasati 30 support helped us make stories of people in Al -Hodaydah . What we learned 
helped us build stories simply and attractively tailored to social media. This change in our 
style made people interact with our content more than before, and it was reflected in the 
increased number of likes, comments and shares. Support has also helped us build a new 
strategy to use short writings and supportive designs, depending more on multimedia to 
convey tailored messages for young people. “

ENSURING ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PARTICIPATION 10
After 7years ofwar and despite several round ofpeace talks negotiation, theYemeni conflict threaten every day
more thelifeofitspopulation and thefuture ofitsyouth .Asthepolitical landscape, themedia landscape ishighly
polarized with thespread ofhate speech and disinformation, fuelling further theconflict and thecountry’s division .
While freedom ofexpression and access toinformation areessential tobuild strong and united communities and
ensure sustainability ofthe state through transparency and accountability, spaces forexpression inYemen are
reduced and access toinformation islimited .This isparticularly the case forthe Youth and forwomen, being
excluded from public discussions .The project “Empowering Yemeni Youth towards Peace :Ensuring access to
information and participation” aimed atanswering acrucial problematic, the absence of70%ofthe Yemeni
population, the Youth ,inthepeacebuilding process .The Youth isamong thefirst victim oftheongoing conflict,
being deprived notonly oftheir voices butalso oftheir present and oftheir future .This project sought toprovide the
Yemeni youth with anunbiased information about peace development inYemen, offer them spaces toexpress
themselves and share their opinion, amplify their voice sotobeheard bythemain stakeholders, and make the
peacebuilding process more inclusive .
63One ofthefirst step oftheinitiative was togive access toaquality information fortheyouth tobebetter informed
and able toformulate their needs and opinions based onunbiased facts .Through capacity building ofyoung Yemeni
journalists, thecreation oftheRoad toPeace page butalso through collaboration with community radios, sensitizing
them totheimportance ofYouth and Women representation, new information channels and contents were created .
This project, relying mainly onmedia content production and online platforms, showed that using innovative digital
tools canmake adifference inYouth and Women inclusion .More than ever inthepast, theworld isultra -connected,
everything goes and happens online, and one ofthe main public ofonline platforms isthe Youth .While this
evolution provides aformidable opportunity toaccelerate change, enhance communication, and facilitate unified
action, notknowing thecodes and usage ofmedia platforms canalso lead totheraise ofmisinformation and further
worsen thedivision ofcountry already destabilised .Through capacity building, supervision from media professional
and smart online moderation tofoster engagement, theproject succeeded inprotecting itsusers and providing
them with asafe online space fordialogue, giving thepriority towomen and theyouth insharing their opinions .
The project contributed tochange thenarrative and reposition theyouth atthecentre ofthediscussion .Whether
through the sixsurveys conducted, the 5debates organized, the 14peacebuilding initiative supported oryouth
participation tointernational events, the opinions ofyoung Yemenis were directly shared with the main
stakeholders, demonstrating notonly thefullcapacity oftheYouth toexpress itself butalso theimportance oftheir
opinion tobuild thecountry’s future .Itshowcased several success stories echoing thestruggle and hardships but
also theresilience and creativity oftheYemeni youth and their strong willtofight fortheir future and seetheconflict
ending .Outside the scope ofYemen, this project has demonstrated how social media, online communication
platforms and media productions, canbeleveraged tofoster freedom ofexpression and access toinformation, and
provide Youth living incountries inconflict with new venues and spaces toexpress themselves and make their
voices heard .64UNESCO would like tothanks itspartners without whom this project wouldn’t
have been possible, starting bytheUnited Nations Peacebuilding that funded this
project, and RNW Media foritsinvolvement intheproject asmain implementing

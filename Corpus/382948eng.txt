digital 
platforms: 
A multistakeholder 
approach
Together, we will shape an 
internet for trust
The internet and social media have empowered 
people to communicate, create and transform 
the world. However, disinformation, hate speech 
and conspiracy theories are affecting the fabric 
of our societies, sowing distrust, creating 
confusion, and sometimes undermining the 
institutions that are necessary for a peaceful 
coexistence.
The prevalence of such harmful content should 
not negate the incredible power of platforms to 
provide access to information. Attempts to 
regulate content should also not limit people’s 
right to freedom of expression as well as other 
human rights.
We therefore need to come together to address 
one of the deﬁning questions of our age, which 
has implications for democracy and human 
rights worldwide: the challenge of how 
regulation can enable freedom of expression and 
inclusion and at the same time promote the 
availability of accurate and reliable information.What is it about?
The ﬁrst version of the guidelines for digital 
platform regulation will focus on/uni00A0structures 
and processes, including issues such as:
Who are the guided entities?
• Governments. To promote and protect freedom of 
expression and human rights online.
• Regulatory systems. To ensure independence and 
adequate oversight.

practices consistent with human rights standards.

TOWARDS GUIDELINES FOR 
REGULATING DIGITAL PLATFORMS FOR 
INFORMATION AS A PUBLIC GOOD
GLOBAL CONFERENCE, UNESCO HQ
PARIS / 21—23 FEBRUARY, 2023

António Guterres

“We cannot leave it 
to private 
companies to 
resolve this 
existential issue 
themselves. Our 
aim is to collectively 
deﬁne the 
principles and 
processes of 
content moderation 
and curation, while 
respecting human 
rights, and in 
particular freedom 
of expression.”
“A safe, secure 
digital space begins 
with the protection 
of free speech. But 
it doesn’t end there. 
Governments, 
companies & social 
media platforms 
have a 
responsibility to 
prevent hate 
speech, bullying & 
disinformation, 
which undermine 
human rights, 
democracy & 
science.”

1. Executive Summary  
 
This report is submitted to the Intergovernmental Council of the International Programme for 
the Development of Communication (IPDC) in line with the  Decision  of the Council adopted at 
32nd session requesting the Secretariat to "continue publishing a biennial report on worldwide 
progress towards SDG indicator 16.10.2.” 1 
 
The present report responds to the IPDC Council mandate by taking stock of the global 
progress on the adoption and implementation of legal guarantees on Access to Information, 
based primarily on information provided by Member States through UNESCO’s 2021 survey 
on indicator 16.10.2, the results of which were published in : To recovery and beyond: 2021 
UNESCO report on public access to information (SDG 16.10.2) , and t he 2022 survey , the 
results of which will be published later in 2022 . 
 Its conclusion provides insight into  the main tendencies in the implementation of legal 
guarantees for public Access to I nformation worldwide. The findings enable a better 
understanding of the gaps and challenges that need to be addressed by countries in their efforts towards ach ieving this SDG indicator . 
 
2. Background and Context  
 As custodian agency for SDG indicator 16.10.2, in 2021 and in 2022, UNESCO invited all UN Member States, to participate in annual surveys on SDG indicator 16.10.2. The surveys took 
place from April to June  2021 and from April to May 2022. As many as 102 countries and 
territories, responded to the survey in 2021, while in 2022 the number of respondent  countries 
and territories reached 123.

2020- 2022

Number  69 102 123 
 
In July 2021, the UN’s Inter -Agency and Expert Group on the Sustainable Development Goal 
Indicators (IAEG -SDGs) validated the updated metadata guidance for indicator 16.10.2, which 
includes the use of the UNESCO survey to collect the data annually.  The survey comprises 8 
questions2, each  with values between 0 and 2. Upon the completion of the survey, a country 
can get a total s core of 0- 9, enabling it to track progress over time. The total score of each 
country is the basis for a global analysis  of trends as reported here.    
 
An example of the usage of such data relates to the importance of oversight bodies.  Thus, t he 
global analysis of data collected in 2022 shows  that countries and territories with legal 
guarantees on Access to Information  that include provision for an oversight body, have an 
average score of 7.2 , while those  with guarantees but no oversight institution score on average 
3.3 points. This finding suggest s that countries  and territories  that have a specialised Access 
to Information oversight body are generally likely to perform better than those without  it.

2 The questions were based on what can be called ‘ Principles of Access to Information ’, and which 
highlight  essential components for effective implementation of access to information at the country level. 
These Principles are synthesized from existing frameworks and documents recognised internationally. 
These include Article 10 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption; resolutions of the UN 
General Assembly and Human Rights Council; the Commonwealth’s Model Freedom of Information Bill; 
Organization of American States (OAS)’s Model Law on Access to Information; African Union’s Model 
Law on Access to Information and reports from the UN the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and  
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression.  CI-22/COUNCIL.33/ 7 – page 3 
 
  
In order to help establish a reporting link for SDG indicator 16.10.2 at the national level, 
UNESCO sent the 2021 and 2022 survey invitations to both the central oversight institutions 
responsible for A ccess to Information (e.g. information commission/er; data protection or 
privacy commission/er; national human rights institution; ombuds institution; department/ ministry/ agency) and national SDG focal points (usually the national statistics offices). In some 
countries  and territories, the invitation was sent to only one of these entities, due the absence 
of one or another.  
 UNESCO also joined forces with networks of oversight institutions responsible for A ccess to 
Information, such as the International Conference of Information Commissioners
 (ICIC) , 
regional associations : Red de Transparencia y Acceso a la Información  (regional Latin 
American network of information commissioners) and the African Network of Information 
Commissioners (ANIC),  so as  to increase participation of countries and territories in the survey. 
Such outreach is important as these networks play an important role in advocating for SDG 
monitoring and reporting, as well as mobilising their members in taking part in global activities related to the SDGs.  
 
3. Tracking progress in 2022 
3.1 Legal frameworks for Access to Information: growth of reporting on adopting and 
implementing legal and policy guarantees for access to information 
 Out of the 123 countries and territories that responded to the survey  in 2022, 93% (114) 
indicated that they have constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for A ccess to 
Information . In 2021, out of the 102 respondent countries and territories, 89% or 91 jurisdictions 
indicated hav ing such guarantees.  
 Five countries indicated in 2022 an absence of any Access to Information guarantees, 
including one country noting that the right is only ‘ indirectly mentioned’ in their legislation on 
print and publishing, on s tatistics and on the environment , as articles in these legislations 
‘required the publication of certain information to the public. ’ Another country acknowledged 
having a non- binding policy on A ccess to I nformation that makes ‘ more Government data 
available to the public. ’  
 Four  countries further reported that they are ‘in progress’ in adopting such guarantees.  
 
In 2021, two countries  reported to UNESCO that they had adopted legal guarantees, while 
three more countries  reported in 2022 that they too had passed and enforced their national 
laws on A ccess to I nformation.  One country  reported that its new Open Government Act 
replaces  the now defunct Freedom of Information Act , and contains a number of important 
changes, including the establishment of the permanent independent Advisory committee on public access and information management.  
 Thus, a steady growth of both the number of national regulation systems conducive to A ccess 
to Information is evident from the 2021 and 2022 surveys.   
 
Out of the 114 jurisdictions with A ccess to Information guarantees, 90% (103) reported in 2022 
that these provisions  specify the need of a dedicated oversight institution(- s).  Out of these  114 
jurisdictions , 79% (90) pointed in their 2022 reports that these guarantees specifically provide 
for the need for public bodies (ministry/agency/department ) to appoint public information 
officers or a specific unit /s to handle A ccess to I nformation. Out o f the 90, 89% (80) said that 
these requirements are for all  public bodies, while the rest – only to some  of the bodies.  In 
2021, 71% (65) countries and territories (out of the 91 with Access to Information guarantees  
at the time ) reported the need to  appoint public information officers or units . In 62 countries  
and territories , this provision applied to ‘all public bodies’ and in three more – only to ‘some 
public bodies .’ 
  CI-22/COUNCIL.33/ 7 – page 4 
 
  
The statistics point to the importance of oversight bodies  and to the requirem ent for the public 
bodies to appoint officers handling Access to Information issues.  
 
3.2 Exemptions: limited scope, but overall existence to protect public interests and human 
rights  
 
Permissible exemptions that are elaborated in well -defined categories allow the withholding by 
authorities of certain categories of information, in terms of international standards of Access to 
Information . Exemptions should apply only where there is a ris k of substantial harm to a 
protected interest (as per the list in Figure 2 below) or human right, and where the possible harm is greater than the overall public interest in having Access to I nformation. These 
exemptions are typically cited in jurisdiction’ s legal guarantees on Access to Information in 
relation to the procedures for requests for information, and also in regard to rationales for 
refusals in requests.  
 
Out of the 114 responding jurisdictions with Access to Information  legal guarantees, the overall 
majority – 96% (110) – reported in 2022 that their respective guarantees explicitly mention 
having permissible exemptions that are elaborated in well -defined categories and terms of 
which certain requests for information may be lega lly denied. In 2021, out of the 91 responding 
countries and territories with Access to Information guarantees at the time , such exemptions 
were mentioned by 9 1% (83).  
 
Figure 2 below shows the proportion of permissible exemptions in Access to Information legal 
guarantees, as indicated by the respondents  in 2021 and in 2022 .

 Going further, Access to Information oversight institutions in 28  out of 4 4 countries and 
territories that provided  specific data on ‘ Access to Information requests’ in 2021 reported that 
they kept disaggregated data on the reasons for non- disclosure and partial disclosure on the 
basis of the legitimate exemptions. As it relates to specific data on ‘Appeals’ in the same period, 
33 out of 60  respondents repor ted that they also kept disaggregated data.  The proportion of 
the number of countries  and territories  keeping disaggregated data has increased in 2022 from 
the previous year from 60% to 67% in relation to requests for Access to Information and 
decreased in relation to appeals from 57% to 55%.  
 
Figure 3. Countries and territories that keep disaggregated data for non- disclosure 
and partial disclosure on the basis of the permissible exemptions in 2020 and in 2021

(Appeals) in 2020  29 (57%)  22 (43%)  
(Appeals) in 2021  33 (55%)  27 (45%)  
 
These data confirm the overall existence of a limited scope of exemptions for protected 
interests: human rights (such as privacy) and public interests (such as national security) , that 
are explicitly mentioned in the national Access to Information  guarantees, but the number of  
countries  and territories  that keep disaggregated data on refusals to Access to Information  
requests on the basis of exceptions is low.   
 
3.3. Oversight mechanism: growth in numbers and broadness of mandates to implement 
the laws  
 
Oversight mechanism s, which were in the focus of the 2022 survey,  may take the form of an  
institution tasked  with ensuring the process of supervision, monitoring, evaluation  of 
performance and review, in order to ensure compliance with laws, regulations and policies. 
They are  an essential element to ensure  accountability for the implementation of Access to 
Information . The same or another body may also review  appeals, although hearing appeals  is 
a distinct function from oversight and is often  done by a separate body , as well as by a court 
of law . This is why in some countries, there  exists more than one oversight institution, 
depending on the  different tasks that they perform.  
 
In 2022, out of the 114  responding countries and territories with Access to Information 
guarantees, 90% (103) reported that these guarantees specify the need of a dedicated 
oversight institution (-s). In 2021, 87% (79) of the 91 countries  and territories  with Access to 
Informatio n guarantees at the time confirmed  that their guarantees recognized such a need.   
 
In 2022 , Information Commission/er s were the most  common type of oversight mechanism  (47 
countries/territories reported having an Information Commission/er ), followed by governmental 
department s/ministries /agencies (33) and ombudspersons /institution s (29). Other oversight 
mechanisms include converged bodies  that combine data/privacy protection and A ccess to 
Information  (27), data protection or privacy commission/er s (16), and human rights 
commission s (10). In 22 cases , the reports of the countries and territories with A ccess to 
Information  guarantees  pointed to ‘Other ’ in the list of oversight institutions.3 The picture from 
the 2021 report is not much different  (see Figure 4) , with the exception of the executive  bodies, 
which had a less prominent role at the time.  
 
3 A detaile d review of their answers, however , discovers some misunderstanding as the ‘other 
institutions ’ turned out also to include information commissions under a different name (board, council, 
authority and agency), ‘ personal data authorities ’, government bodies, other than the ministries and 
departments, as well as courts and prosecution services which anyway have a general right to overview 
compliance with a law. In two cases , it was recorded in 2022 that the Access to Information oversight i s 
done by a media regulator (Media Commission and Office of the Inspector of Journalist Ethics).  CI-22/COUNCIL.33/ 7 – page 6 
 
  
In the majority of countries  and territories, these oversight institutions reportedly operate at the 
national level,  with only few of them –  typically federative states –  indicating the existence 
(also) of  the subnational  level.  Both in 2021 and in 2022, subnational institutions  accounted for  
less than 10 per cent  of existing oversight institutions . 
 
Figure 4. Types of oversight institution  
Type  Number of countries and 
territories (percentage)  
 
2021  2022

Human Rights Commission  3 (4 %)  10 (10 %)  
Other  11 (15 %)  22 (21 %)  
 These figures point to an overall majority of countries and territories with Access to Information  
legal guarantees providing for  an oversight body , typically a national one. In almost half of the 
cases this body takes the form of an Information Commission or Commissioner. There is a 
significant number of the national executive bodies (such as Department/Ministry/Agency) 
taking over the oversight rol e.  
 
The mandates of the oversight institutions in 91 out of the 103 countries and territories that 
provide for  them, according to their 2022  submissions to UNESCO, authorize the oversight 
bodies  to conduct  an oversight (legal responsibility to ensure implementation of the Access to 
Information  guarantee) and the same number also conduct  monitoring of Access to Information 
implementation.
4  
 
Review of the appeals is reportedly possible by 80 oversight Acces s to Information institutions, 
while the same number of oversight bodies have the authority to enforce compliance with the 
Access to Information legal guarantee(s). Just 43 countries and territories reported that their 
institutions may take the role of mediation, an alternative solution to resolve a dispute before 
proceeding to any formal procedure  on Access to Information  issues. Figure 5 puts these 
figures in comparison with those from the 2021 reports, when 79 of 91 jurisdictions with access 
to inform ation guarantees noted that they provide for an oversight mechanism .

 43 (42 %)  
 Oversight and monitoring of the implementation of the Access to Information  legal guarantees 
remain the prime task of the oversight institutions in the majority of countries and territories 
that responded to the surveys. Other important tasks  cited by respondents  are the review of 
appeals and the enforcement of compliance. Mediat ion is still largely undeveloped as a 
mandated role of such bodies.  
 
The independence of oversight institutions  is essential for them to  play an effective role. 
Factors such as the appointment process of the head of the oversight institution, the way 
institution is financed, and to whom it reports , determine the independence of the oversight 
body.  
 
The 2022 survey revealed that , out of the 103 responding countries and territories with Access 
to Information  legal guarantees that specify the need of a dedicated oversight institution( -s), 
the majority ( 63) indicated that the head of the A ccess to Information oversight institution is 
appointed by the ‘Executive’.
5 The ‘Legislative’ branch is the second most answered ( 36), 
followed with ‘Other’ ( 21)’6 and ‘Judiciary’ ( 3). 
 
In response to the survey question about the approval of the budget for the access to 
information oversight institution, 62 respondents indicated that this budget is approved by the 
’Legislative’ branch, while 47 indicated that it is approved by the ’Executive’, and three 
indicated that it is approved by the ’Judiciary’. Meanwhile, 12 countries indicated ‘Other’ in their 
responses, explaining, for example,  that the budget of the A ccess to Information institution 
comes from that of the Ministry of Justice, or is approved through a complex procedure 
involving different stakeholders.  
 In response to the survey question about to whom the Access to Information oversight 
institution directly reports about its activities
7, 68 respondents indicated that the budget is 
approved by the ’Legislative’ branch, while 49  indicated that it is approved by the ’Executive’, 
and four indicated that it is approved by the ’Judiciary’ . 
 
For the latter, some respondents said  that the institution report s to ‘the public ’, while others 
explained they do not report to any branches  of state power . Meanwhile several  countries 
either put ‘ government ’, a specific ‘ministry ’ or ‘parliament ’ under ‘Other’ .  
  
 
5 For this question, respondents could choose one or more branches of  government, as applicable.  
6 Such as the Head of State or a complicated procedure involving several branches of power.

Figure 6 puts these figures in comparison with those from the 2021 reports, when 79 of 91 
jurisdictions noted that they provide for an oversight mechanism .

Looking at the trends related to independence of the oversight  bodies , there is a  significant  
change in the reporting process : the recipient of the oversight  reports is increasingly the 
legislative rather than the executive branch of power . The legislatures are also specified as 
approv ing the budget for oversight activities, while the appoint ment  of the head of the oversight 
institution  is more often made by the execut ive.  
 
In response to the survey question whether reporting on the activities performed by such 
institution( -s) is required, 98 out of the 103 countries and territories with Access to Information 
guarantees for a dedicated oversight institution( -s) indicated a positive reply to the question, 
but only 83 countries and territories said that an annual report was indeed published in 2021.  
  CI-22/COUNCIL.33/ 7 – page 9 
 
  
In response to the survey question about the types of activities actually performed by the 
dedicated oversight institutions in 2021,  the respondents indicated that these bodies : provided 
implementation guidance and/or offered training to officials from public bodies 
(ministry/agency/department ) in 84 cases; were engaged in activities to raise public awareness 
– in 87 cases ; kept statistics on requests and/or appeals –  in 82 cases; and/or requested public 
bodies to keep statistics of their activities and decisions –  in 65 cases . However, there is a 
caveat here. Some countries and territories that reported on keeping statistics did not provide 
specific  data to UNESCO in their response to the relevant questions. On the other hand, a few 
others reported that they did not keep statistics, but still pro vided specific  data in their reports. 
This may speak of  some inconsistencies in record -keeping practices.

78 A number of survey responses from 2022 pointed to other activities of the Access to 
Information  oversight institutions, such as : proactive publication of information, for example  
minutes of Cabinet meetings; facilitation of access to people wit h disabilities;  establishing 
transparency platforms; strengthening public awareness on C OVID -19 vaccination.  These 
activities  can be considered good practices  in terms of Access to Information standards . 
 
In addition, good practices with regard to promoting gender equality in A ccess to Information 
were described in 24 reports  in 2022 . These included such activities as implementing action 
plans and specific policies on gender mainstreaming, as well as awareness raising through 
seminars and other programmatic activities . Some of the reports  from Latin America provided 
more detailed answers, such as : an agreement between the Institute for Access to Public 
Information and the Attorney General’s Office ‘to strengthen women’s rights’ ; ‘a workshop with 
women’s organizations and feminist movement to articulate a roadmap on transparency, 
gender and A ccess to I nformation’ (in one country) ; ‘incorporation of actions for the inclusion 
of women in the strategy of access to public information of the Office of the Attorney General’ ; 
and a reference in the  resolution of the ICT Ministry to request the subjects of A ccess to 
Information  Law to include on their website s specific markings pointing to the information that 
might be of interest to  women (in one country ). 
 
For ensuring optimum Access to Information, i t remains crucial to assess, both qualitatively 
and quantitatively, the implementation of this right , so that jurisdictions can take corrective 
actions where needs be.  
 CI-22/COUNCIL.33/ 7 – page 10  
 
 In 2022, 59 out of the 103 oversight institutions reportedly confirmed that they had received 
reports on Access to Information  requests from the public bodies (ministry/agency/department) 
at the national level.  
 
An important  indicator that can help monitor effectiveness of the oversight bodies is the 
availability of data on the number of requests re ceived by them and the manner  they were 
responded. Out of the 114  responding countries and territories with A ccess to Information  
guarantees  in 2022, only  51 (45%) could provide meaningful data on the number of requests ; 
moreover , 12 of the se 51 response s (24%) were not based on the year 2021 as reporting year, 
submitting instead data from 2020, 2019, or even from 2018, as the latest available. Of the 
remaining 63 countries  and territories  without data, it  is important to note that quite a few still 
confirmed  keeping statistics on requests and/or appeals  even though they were unable to 
mobilise such data for the survey response.  
 
From the data made available in 2022 by 39  countries and territories, the majority of A ccess 
to Information  requests were granted ( 3,531,063 or 77 % of the received requests ) in full or in 
part. Although the range of the number of requests for information received is tremendous – from several requests to hundred s of thousands per year per jurisdiction , these figures  
generally show that there is both the demand for and positive response by these countries and 
territories in implementing Access to Information  guarantees.  Whether this means that such 
information should have been proactively availed is worth asking, since such practice avoids 
the situation of citizens needing to request and authorities having to respond.  
 
From the data available in 2021 submissions as reported by the 40 countries and territories, 
the majority of A ccess to Information requests were granted (75% of cases) and only 13% 
were denied, with the remainder being dismissed as ineligible (8%) and pending (4%).  
 
Figure 7. Access to Information requests  granted (percentage of all requests)  
Request s granted according to 2021 survey  75% 
Requests granted according to 2022 survey  77% 
 
Thus , a trend of about three quarters  of all requests being granted can be observed from the 
submissions in 2021 and 2022. However, this trend is detected based on rather small number 
of countries that provided statistics on the numbers of actual requests submitted.  
 
4. Conclusion  
 
The number and ratio of responding countries and territories that indicated to have 
constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for Access to Information  is increasing, year 
to year, since UNESCO started to monitor SDG 16.10.2 in 2019.    
Legal and policy guarantees largely include the need for an oversight body and a requirement 
for the public bodies to appoint officers handling Access to Information issues.  The oversight 
body  is typically a national one, and in almost half of the cases this body takes the form of an 
Information Commission or Commissioner.  One of the key aspects of such body is its 
independence. The International Conference of Information Commissioners defines in its 
Charter independence as institutional, operational and decision-m aking independence, which 
includes the ability to allocate and manage their resources as they see fit to fulfil their 
respective mandates.

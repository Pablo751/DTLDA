Excellences, Ladies and Gentlem en,  
 
Since Thursday, 6  May 2021, we have exchanged in a collegial and respectful manner, 
comments and interventions on the proposed first d raft text.  
 
This session of the Intergovernmental special committee meeting related to the draft UNESCO 
Recommendat ion on Open Science  opened on 6 May 2021 with over 220 participants from 
107 Member States, 62 observes from various intergovernmental / non- governmental 
organizations participated and deliberated on the dr aft Recommendation on Open Science.  
 
The UNESCO Assistant Director -General (ADG) for the Natural Sciences, Ms Shamila Nair -
Bedouelle, opened the meeting with an introductory speech highlighting the role of Science in the service of people, planet and prosperity and the recognition of the urgent need for Open 
Science as a powerful tool to reduce the existing science technology and innovation gaps, to 
accelerate the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and fulfill 
the human right to science.  
 
The election of the Chair person, the Vice- Chairpersons and the Rapporteur then took place to 
establish the Meeting Bureau. Ms Vera El Khoury Lacoeuilhe, Saint Lucia, was elected as the Chairperson of the Meeting. The Vice- Chairpersons were from the following countries , in 
alphabetical order: Armenia Canada,  Egypt, Sri Lanka . Mr Hendrix Kaand Paipi from Zambia,

Ms Shamila Nair -Bedouelle, Assistant Director -General for the Natural Sciences, presented 
the consultative process that led to the proposed normative instrument and summarized the 
key parts of the draft Recommendation.  
 
The meeting adopted the draft Agenda and Rules of Procedure. Further to the proposal from 
the Chairperson, the meeting decided to amend the draft Timetable and extend the sessions 
for additional three hours.   
 
At the start of debate, the delegates of 41 UNESCO Member States and 12 Observers took 
the floor to welcome the draft Recommendation and commend the Secretariat for its work on 
the consultative process for providing a comprehensive document for achieving a global 
consensus on Open Science.  
 
In general, the Member States acknowledged the urgency of Open Science for addressing 
global challenges including the current COVID -19 pandemic and highlighted key issues, such 
as the need for balance between restrictions and openness; involvement of diverse 
stakeholders and knowledge holders in the scientific processes; revision of the current 
evaluation systems; sustainability of open science infrastructures and international 
collaboration in capacity building for open science.  
 
The statements noted that Open Science is the new way for practicing science and 
accelerating the transition of scientific discoveries to innov ations for the benefit of all.  The 
importance of open access to sc ientific knowledge and collaboration in the context of the 
COVID -19 crisis as well as for addressing other global challenges faced by humanity was also 
acknowledged by many .  
 
Throughout these last days, there was a lively and scientific discussions on the content of the 
Recommendation. The Chair brought out  consensus among all Member States by carefully 
listening to their opinions and suggestions and enabling a fruitful dialogue. Wherever possible, 
all the suggestion / additions / deletions  were adopted for the common cause and consensus.   
 SC-PCB-SPP/2021/OS -IGM/INF3 . 
Ladies and Gentlemen, I am pleased to inform you that we have completed the task and we 
have a final draft UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science that is ready for approval today 
from Member States and submission to the 41st General Conference in November  of this year 
for final adoption.   
I have noted a few highlights to share with you:  
 
• The appreciation from Member States of the consultative process leading to this 
Recommendation.   
• The importance of academic freedom, human rights and gender equality -based 
approaches for the Open Science practices and the need to align actions relating to open 
science and open educational resources.  
• The need for balancing intellectual property rights  and openness and the inclusion of 
diversity of actors in scientific processes.  
• The importance of consider ing science as public good, therefore international cooperation 
and long- term investment in non -profit and community -based infrastructures with 
interconnectivity and interoperability need to be promoted  by all countries.  
• The need  for international cooperation, access to knowledge without embargos and 
empowerment  through human rights  of marginalized groups .  
• The importance of equity of access for all publication systems and the need for 
bibliodiversity and multilingualism.  
• The need for a flexible Open Science instrument which encompasses different actors  
• and builds on existing regulations, such as the existing intellectual property frameworks.  
• The eff iciency of the North- South and South- South cooperation and engagement was 
emphasized during the preparatory process of the Recommendation, which should be 
continued through scientific collaborations, building common infrastructures and capacity 
building wi thout blockages and sanctions.  
• The need for i nclusion of Open Science in national science technology and innovation 
policy strategies  and the need for respect for indigenous knowledge systems and 
cooperation in building infrastructures and exercising flex ibilities in the times of global 
crisis.   
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
Since the beginning of the process of  elaboration of this  UNESCO Recommendation on Open 
Science, which started  at the 40
th General Conference  in November 2019 , UNESCO 
established the Advisory Committee and organized several national, regional and international 
consultations. We are here today in the intergovernmental special committee meeting. During 
the process,  we had a number of opportunities to actively engage in a dynamic and open 
debate over the nature and content of the Recommendation. We have now completed this 
elaboration phase with the adopted text you have before you. W ith your approval and support 
this text  will be submitted to 41st  General Conference of UNESCO for final adoption by all 193 
UNESCO Member S tates.   
 Colleagues, Madam Chair, as this is the last time I address you as the Rapporteur for the 
intergovernmental committee on the elaboration of this draft Recommendation, I would like to 
thank you all for your pa tience and kindness. It has been an honor  and a privilege to serve as 
your Rapporteur.  
 
Dear Member States, you have made history today. I send you my congratulations for this 
exemplary Recommendation.  
 
Thank you  
SC-PCB-SPP/2021/OS -IGM/INF3 .

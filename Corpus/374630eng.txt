Cities are the cradles of civilizations, the beacons of knowledge and creativity, and the engines of economic 
and social progress in the world. Today, 58% of the total Arab population lives in cities, a proportion likely to reach 75% by 2050. Arab city leaders have a major responsibility to plan thoroughly for this unprecedented urban expansion, shifting promptly to innovative methods that will allow them to face foreseen challenges. 
Real, sustainable urban development is necessarily inclusive, offering all city inhabitants equal opportunities 
in the various spheres of life, including benefit from basic services, access to information, and participation in local decision-making. Indeed, exclusion - in any dimension it may present itself - challenges the ability of Arab countries to achieve human development where no one is left behind, and hampers the fulfilment of commitments stipulated in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its seventeen goals. Seeking inclusion is even more critical in light of the fact that Arab cities are becoming increasingly more diverse and multi-cultural.
Hence the importance of the Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities, which was prepared in response to 
the recommendation of members of the Coalition of Arab Cities against Racism, Discrimination, Xenophobia 
and Intolerance. Member cities have identified a need for reference material that is relevant to their context and that addresses priority urban inclusion issues, in line with Sustainable Development Goal 11 and the New Urban Agenda.
The Toolkit that we present today provides practical, viable guidance to city actors in the region to promote urban 
inclusion; as well as advice proven by the actual experiences of Arab cities and inspired by their accumulated knowledge in planning, implementing and evaluating their local programs and projects. It is therefore a guide “from Arab cities, to Arab cities”. The Toolkit covers four priority topics, namely: public participation, access to information, sport for youth inclusion, and citizenship and human rights education.
We would like to express our profound gratitude to contributing Arab cities for sharing their experiences and 
knowledge, which are at the core of this publication. We also thank the many experts and young people who contributed to preparing, reviewing and enriching it. 
We hope that this Toolkit, through its participatory and applied approach, will support Arab city officials in 
their endeavors to build inclusive and sustainable cities. We also hope that the ideas presented will inspire Arab cities to seek new horizons of collaboration and the implementation of joint projects. We at UNESCO and the European Training and Research Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Graz remain committed to supporting Arab cities through technical advice, capacity development, and the facilitation of networking and experience exchanges.

Urbanization is “one of the twenty-first century’s most transformative trends.”1 Cities currently host more 
than half of the world’s population and generate more than 80% of the global gross domestic product.2 This 
emphasizes, today more than ever, their fundamental role as economic, social, and cultural development hubs. 
This applies to all regions of the world including the Arab region, where more than 58% of the population lives in urban areas,
3 a figure that is likely to reach 75% by 2050.4  
Arab cities are undergoing large-scale social transformations and population movements. They host large numbers of refugees, internally displaced persons, and migrant workers, and have transformed into heterogeneous spaces, bringing together different identities, cultures and races. Consequently, Arab local authorities have a growing responsibility towards establishing inclusive cities, securing equal opportunities for all, providing access to basic services and information, and enabling effective public participation in decision-making. In line with these aims, city actors – including local government employees, members of elected councils and development organizations – need to: adopt rights-based, people-centered approaches; develop and implement local policies and comprehensive plans that combat social divides; include all inhabitants in the development process; and promote a culture of citizenship. They should strive to ensure equal representation of women and men in the various spheres of life; provide formal and informal platforms for youth to express their opinions and aspirations; and protect the rights of various groups, such as the rights of children to a safe and healthy environment, of persons with disabilities to work and access public places, and of refugees and displaced persons to decent life, jobs and housing.
The adoption of good urban governance frameworks that integrate the principles of transparency, justice, equality and accountability contributes directly to the achievement of social inclusion. Such frameworks help local governments to establish constructive communication channels, respond to city inhabitants’ needs, develop relationships with the private sector and civil society organizations to deliver quality and efficient basic services, and exploit the prospects of information technology in promoting transformation into a smart city.
Recognizing the growing role of cities and 
its centrality, UNESCO launched in 2004 the International Coalition of Inclusive and Sustainable Cities (ICCAR) as a network of cities interested in sharing experiences in order to improve  
policies against racism, discrimination,  
xenophobia and exclusion. Under the umbrella of ICCAR, regional coalitions were established, each with its respective Ten-Point Plan of Action, including the Coalition of Arab Cities against Racism, Discrimination, Xenophobia  
and Intolerance.

About the Toolkit and its objectives
The Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities aims to provide Arab city leaders and local government officials 
with practical tools and advice to build inclusive and sustainable cities. The Toolkit reflects the real experiences and practices of participating cities; it documents their accumulated transferrable and tacit knowledge, compiling it into policy models that can help city officials achieve the following: 
 Gai
n societal acceptance and political backing for their proposed policies and programs,  
by providing a good evidence base supporting their proposals, and demonstrating the links  
to international commitments and conventions.
 Adopt 
an inclusive and integrated approach in designing, planning, implementing and evaluating 
local policies and programs (according to the policy-making cycle) to ensure the rights of all  
city inhabitants.
 Achieve 
participation through the effective involvement of different social groups and  
stakeholders, to ensure the success and continuity of policies and programs.
 Promote a holistic vision and the ability to foresee potential challenges facing the implementation 
 
of 
policies and programs, by learning about similar city practices and measures adopted to address these 
challenges and ensure the successful implementation and continuity of programs.
 Acquire practical tools and models that can be applied during the different stages of work.,,,,Arab states are supporting cities member of the Arab coalition to achieve urban inclusion and  
to develop the necessary capacities to build  
inclusive and sustainable cities where “no one  
is left behind”. Arab cities have emphasized their commitment to achieve urban inclusion  
in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable  
Development and the New Urban Agenda,  
as well as their willingness to collaborate  
and share good practices, knowledge,  
and experiences in this regard.
In this context, the need to develop reference guides 
and materials on urban inclusion was raised in a number of workshops organized by UNESCO Cairo Office with the participation of cities members of the Arab Coalition. It was agreed to benefit from the successful experience of the European Coalition of Cities against Racism – ECCAR’s “Toolkit for 
Equality: City Policies against Racism”
6 in preparing the Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities as a 
reference that is tailored to the specific needs of the Arab region. Cities members of the Arab Coalition have expressed their willingness to contribute technically to the elaboration of the Toolkit as a practical guide prepared “by Arab cities for Arab cities”.Introduction5The Toolkit is not meant to document in detail specific urban inclusion policies and programs carried out by 
Arab cities -- for these are certainly too many to include in a single document. However, it briefly presents some city examples to clarify and articulate a proposed idea. We also hope that these examples will encourage cooperation and networking among Arab cities. It is also worth mentioning that the Toolkit does not aim to provide blueprints or prescriptive “models”; rather, it proposes practical guidance and advice that cities may benefit from in the way they deem to be most relevant and according to their needs and local conditions.
Each chapter of the Toolkit tackles a specific urban inclusion topic of high relevance to Arab cities. The four 
topics were selected based on the meetings held with participating representatives of Arab cities and are in line with the Ten-Point Plan of Action of the Arab Coalition, and the priorities of Arab cities, UNESCO and the 
European Training and Research Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (ETC Graz). 
The Toolkit is published under the “Inclusive and Sustainable Cities Series” issued by the Social and 
Human Sciences Sector at UNESCO. It is expected to be published as an online interactive document.
Target groups
The Toolkit mainly targets the following groups:
 Mayors;
 Members of Municipality Councils;
 Municipal executives;
 Entities concerned with the design,  
implementation, follow-up, and evaluation  
of local projects and programs.[…] any superiority deriving 
from racism, discrimination, or intolerance is scientifically and morally false, unjust, and socially dangerous. It should be condemned as it impedes the development of individuals and communities […]
Excerpt from the statement of Dr. Youssef Al Shawarbeh, Mayor of Greater Amman, Municipality, in the opening of the workshop on the development of the Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities (Amman, March 2019).,,,, Structure of the Toolkit
The Toolkit includes the following four chapters:
1. Public Participation:
Methods and mechanisms – both formal and informal – adopted by cities to promote public  
participation in city planning and decision making at the local level. Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities62. Access to Information: 
Methods and mechanisms used by cities to meet the information needs of inhabitants, including the provision 
and regular updating of adequate and accurate information, making it accessible to the general public.
3. Sport for Youth Inclusion:
Sports-based initiatives and programs, especially for youth, supported by cities to promote social inclusion.
4. Citizenship and Human Rights Education:

The content of the Toolkit chapters was  
developed by organizing two workshops  
that aimed to document the tacit knowledge 
accumulated by Arab cities through experience, and which could be transferred to benefit other cities. The workshops were attended by nominated representatives of the Arab Coalition member cities who have the practical experience and knowledge in local policy-making and implementing and are well acquainted with the topics of the Toolkit. Experts from international organizations, academic institutions, and civil society organizations who have long experience in inclusive urban policies also joined the workshops.We aim to achieve cities and 
human settlements where all persons are able to enjoy equal rights and opportunities, as well as their fundamental freedoms, guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including full respect for international law.
The New Urban Agenda, para. 12.
The first workshop was held in October 2018 in Cairo, Egypt over three and a half days to discuss two topics, 
public participation and access to information. The second workshop was organized in March 2019 in Amman, Jordan under the auspices of the Mayor of Greater Amman Municipality. Over three days, participants discussed the other two topics of the Toolkit, namely sport for youth inclusion and citizenship and human rights education. Youth representatives were invited to participate in the second workshop following a recommendation from the first workshop, and taking into consideration that one of the discussed topics was of direct relevance to youth. They enriched the discussions by sharing their experiences in local development and voluntary work, their suggestions for improving cities’ performance, and their vision on how to achieve sustainable and inclusive cities.
The workshops were highly interactive; city representatives worked in groups moderated by UNESCO, ETC-Graz 
and urban inclusion experts. A set of guiding questions were asked during the working groups addressing the following aspects:
 The 
concepts, human rights aspects, arguments and evidences backing the programs, as well as the 
conditions that enabled implementation of the programs.
 Iden
tification and engagement of stakeholders, key practical steps, public outreach, and implementation 
challenges faced by cities and how they were overcome.
 Evaluation indicators used, follow-up actions, success and sustainability factors and lessons learned.
The 
information generated during the working groups constituted most of the content of the Toolkit. 
The four chapters were drafted by a group of urban inclusion experts (Takween Integrated Community Development, Egypt) who also facilitated the above-mentioned workshops. The Toolkit was peer reviewed by city representatives as well as by regional and international experts and finalized by UNESCO.

Commit to involving city inhabitants and enhancing the 
contributions of as many of them as possible throughout the policy-making cycle.
Respond efficiently to the demands and needs raised by 
the city inhabitants.
Educate the public about their rights and responsibilities to 
ensure that their participation is effective, not nominal.Ensure equal and fair representation of all groups of 
inhabitants as well as non-governmental actors.1

1. Why public participation?
1.1 The relevance of public participation at city level
Public participation enables local authorities to make rational decisions concerning their cities, as it allows 
them to closely identify the priorities and needs of different groups of inhabitants, and to respond to these priorities and needs through adequate measures, programs and projects. Public participation allows different opinions to be expressed and heard. It allows information, data and options to be identified in a scientific way, and helps in securing the support of concerned parties, whether moral (social support/ acceptance) or material (technical and financial resources).
The topic of public participation has been widely discussed in the literature, notably its role in building public 
consensus on local plans and enhancing sustainability. However, cities are still exploring and examining possible practical means to implement public participation at the local level. In many instances, cities tend to apply different mechanisms and approaches in implementing public participation, depending on the context and institutional framework in each city.Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities141.2 The benefits of public participation according to participating 
Arab cities
 Build public trust in the local governments and strengthen societal support for local policies and plans.
 Build 
a sense of belonging and promote citizenship as a result of the participation of citizens in local 
policy making and implementation, thus developing a sense of responsibility which would lead to higher 
productivity and improvement of the local economy.
 Promote decentralization by enabling local institutions to implement effective public participation. 
 Improve 
the quality of the provided services and programs, and their relevance to the needs of the population, 
and enable city inhabitants to access these services.
 R
aise public understanding about the functions of local institutions, their operating procedures, and the 
restrictions governing the work of different local bodies. 
 Improve 
understanding among city inhabitants of the pursued policies, leading to greater support for their 
implementation.
 Develop 
new and innovative solutions that draw on the specialized technical expertise of the inhabitants, the 
private sector and civil society. 
 Establish 
continuous communication with community members, monitor trends in public opinion, and test 
the extent of societal satisfaction with the city plans and programs.
 E
nable inhabitants to act as observers, monitor the implementation of local policies and plans, hold 
local authorities accountable, and report shortcomings to them through better access to information and continuous dialogue. 
 Achi
eve greater social cohesion, by enabling the participation of marginalized groups in discussions and 
building relationships within and between different communities and social groups (social capital).
 Es
tablish new networks that enable different stakeholders to work together, as a result to building more 
positive relationships based on better knowledge of the parties involved.

Public participation in local administration and political life is one of the most 
important principles supporting a human-rights-based development approach.
Article 21: “Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, 
directly or through freely chosen representatives.” 
Participation is closely associated with the right to freedom of expression

The New Urban Agenda 2016 addresses public participation in different 
paragraphs. For example:
Paragraph 41: “We commit ourselves to promoting institutional, political, legal 
and financial mechanisms in cities and human settlements to broaden inclusive platforms, in line with national policies, that allow meaningful participation in decision-making, planning and follow-up […]”.
Public participation and city functions
Public participation is closely related to the city's function as a democratic institution that works on ensuring a participatory process in which all social groups are represented. Public participation is also related to the city function as a responsible rule-maker  that responds 
to the needs of city inhabitants, and finally as a service provider  
in partnership with different entities to ensure all city inhabitants access these services efficiently and effectively.

2. Planning public participation
2.1 Identifying stakeholders
Arab cities follow different approaches to identify and engage relevant stakeholders (individuals or institutions), such as: 
 Identify 
different stakeholders according to each phase of the policy making cycle (planning, implementation, 
monitoring and evaluation) based on the requirements of each phase. For example, the planning phase may require engaging technical and specialized experts in addition to the direct beneficiaries; or
 Identify 
all stakeholders during the planning phase, and continue to engage them through all phases of the 
policy-making cycle, without any change; or 
 Identify 
stakeholders to be engaged in the planning and evaluation phases only and not in the implementation 
phase.
Stakeholders may be classified into three main groups as shown in the table below:
To ensure the effectiveness of public participation, it is necessary to ensure the involvement of marginalized 
groups and encourage them to participate and express their opinions during the design of plans and programs. Many Arab cities have adopted the following steps in this regard:
 Set 
clear guidelines for the consultation meetings that distinctly identify the purpose of the meeting and the 
expected role of participants, and articulate the messages to be conveyed in a culturally-sensitive way.

Local authorities identified different stakeholders for each phase of the development of Prophet 
Daniel Street in Alexandria, as follows:
Planning phase:
 The city engaged specialized and professional experts in the field of urban development and 
other relevant fields, who were expected to play a role in the implementation (e.g. engineers from Alexandria University and Bibliotheca Alexandrina). 
Implementation phase:
 The c ity engaged stakeholders who will be directly affected, such as residents of the street in 
question, vendors and businesses (attention was paid to the private sector as an active sector). 
Evaluation phase:
 A bigger group of stakeholders were engaged including CSOs that were monitoring and following 
up the implementation of the project.
A prior declaration of the level of participation and its expected outcomes helps avoid 
frustration and promotes transparency and trust among concerned parties.Public Participation19Passive Participation
Top-down approach 
Intended to mobilize the public to carry 
out pre-planned programs. This type pf participation does not affect the decision-making process. City inhabitants are only involved at a later stage or after the decision has been made, and are provided with limited information to assess their reaction.
Success factor:  achievement of the pre-
planned goals, without considering public 
satisfaction or response to the inhabitants’ needs.Active Participation
Bottom-up approach
A fundamental principle of governance and 
a mechanism to promote democracy by involving all population groups in the planning, implementation, and evaluation stages. Active participation depends on the provision of transparent information, consultation and negotiation with stakeholders in the different stages of decision-making. 
Success factor: besides achieving the goals 
of the plan, it is measured by the degree of agreement and the satisfaction of stakeholders with the action plan.2.2 Identifying the form of public participation and its objectives 
Identifying the form of public participation and its objectives helps local authorities to avoid many implementation challenges. The most notable one is the divergence between the expectations of the different parties involved, and which may lead to lack of trust. Therefore, it is essential for those responsible for planning public participation processes to clearly address the following questions so as to prevent multiple interpretations:
 What degree of participation is required?
 What is the purpose (or the expected outcome) of implementing public participation? 
 Who are the direct stakeholders? What are their roles?
 What information can be shared with the public (e.g. the budget of the project)?
 How will 
the results of the public participation process be dealt with, especially in case of conflicting views?
It is advisable to share the answers to the above questions with the parties invited to participate. This is to ensure unified visions and expectations between the city inhabitants and the persons responsible for participation on one hand, and the local officials on the other hand. This will help avoid frustration and distrust that could hinder participation attempts. 
For example, in many cities, officials plan consultation  sessions with city inhabitants, with the aim of listening 
to their comments and suggestions without committing to implement them, while participating inhabitants 
believe these are advisory sessions in the sense that their proposals will be automatically taken. This 
discrepancy in the expectations of both sides often results in inhabitants feeling frustrated and losing trust in officials, although this can be avoided by clarifying the form of participation and the expected goal of the sessions early on.
There are two kinds of public participation:Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities20Within these two types of participation, there are different levels starting from merely informing the stakeholders, 
or consulting with them, to the highest level of public participation - that of stakeholder empowerment. Each level of participation results in different outcomes in terms of engaging inhabitants in the policy-making process. A number of Arab cities have followed the empowerment method, such as the inclusion of young people in the planning stage in Alexandria (Egypt) and Ras el Metn and Sidon (Lebanon), in addition to the participation of private sector companies in Casablanca (Morocco).
Empowerment
The highest level of participation where all decisions are taken jointly throughout the policy-making cycle. Examples of empowerment include joint design of service planning, participation in decision- making and in allocation of resources and provision and evaluation of services.Cooperation
A higher level of participation where officials cooperate with city inhabitants in decision taking whether in the planning, implementation, or evaluation phases. The city inhabitants are also allowed to negotiate and discuss but the authority and final decisions remain in the hands of officials. Conciliation
At this level, officials consult with city inhabitants; however, they decide, in advance, to make simple and specific changes based on the participants' suggestions to satisfy them and make them feel that their participation is effective and influential.Consultation 
It is based on the exchange of views between officials and city inhabitants. To ensure equal opportunities, it is necessary to ensure the participation and influence of as many stakeholders as possible in decision-making. At this level of participation, officials seek the opinion of the city inhabitants; but, they are not obliged to make any changes according to these opinions. Inform 
Least degree of 
participation as policymakers within city administration inform inhabitants of the decisions after they have been made. Public participation depends primarily on the provision and transparent dissemination of information, except in few cases (please see the Access to Information chapter). However, dissemination of information is not sufficient to achieve effective participation. Public Participation212.3 Ensuring continuity
The continuity and success of public participation depend on a number of factors including, for example:
Legislative/ regulatory factors Political/ technical factors Social/ economic factors
 Having a clear definition 
of participation in the law to avoid contradictory interpretations.
 Adopting local policies that describe, in details, the nature and mechanism of participation and the contributors to such mechanism.
 Existence of articles in the law protecting 
local administration 
and municipality staff from accountability if they have engaged inhabitants, changed programs according to their suggestions or shared information.
 Institutionalizing participation within the regulatory frameworks of local administration institutions. Enabling individuals and institutions to obtain the necessary information.
 Empowering city inhabitants and considering them not only as service recipients but also as having the right to make informed decisions.
 Effectiveness of administrative decentralization.
 Availability of supporting national programs / funding. Providing the necessary infrastructure and resources to implement public participation mechanisms.
 Existence of active civil society and community groups. 
 Willingness of the society and local leaders to participate.
 Benefiting from the existing traditional leadership structures in many Arab cities. 
 Acknowledging the existence of marginalized groups and seeking their fair participation.
 Addressing cultural barriers that may prevent certain groups from participation (women for example).Al Azhar Park, Cairo, Egypt
The project aimed to create a green public space over an area of 30 hectares in the center of Cairo, in addition to developing the neighborhood adjacent to the park (Darb Al-Ahmar) while preserving the historical heritage of the area. The project was implemented by international institutions in cooperation and coordination with the Cairo Governorate.
A public participation approach was followed, where meetings and surveys were conducted to identify 
social and economic needs with the participation of the local population, local non-governmental organizations, affiliated bodies to the governorate, representatives of the neighborhood, and businessmen. These groups were involved during all stages of the project, which included information gathering and analysis, problem identification, implementation, maintenance and follow-up, and most importantly, participation in proposing and evaluating solutions and choosing optimal ones.Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities22Participatory diagnosis, Tangier, Morocco
In developing its work program, the city of Tangier adopted a participatory diagnostic approach aimed 
at diagnosing the current situation with the participation of different social groups. The city engaged all local actors including inhabitants, public institutions and civil society, by holding participatory meetings and workshops that contributed to deeply learning about their needs and seeking their proposals on pre-defined topics.

3. Implementing public participation
3.1 Assigning the roles of stakeholders
An adequate and clear identification of the expected role of stakeholders leads to good and efficient implementation of public participation, as suggested in the table below:
Review the stakeholder power analysis matrix available in the “Supporting 
Tools” booklet.Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities243.2 Selecting the method of public participation
The method of public participation is selected according to planned objectives, the form and level of participation, 
and the phase of the policy-making cycle. For example, participatory methods that allow for in-depth dialogue such as focus groups discussions may be adopted during the planning phase, whereas quantitative methods like questionnaires might be preferable during the monitoring and evaluation phase. Each method has its own advantages, disadvantages and enabling success factors as shown in the table below:
Method of 
participationDescriptionSuccess factors/ Practical tipsStrengths and weaknesses
Community 
consultation sessions 
(          Review 
the template for community consultation sessions available in the “Supporting Tools” booklet)Many Arab cities emphasized on the importance of community consultation sessions as a mean of inclusion and public participation. The design of these sessions varies according to the commitment of the organizing authority and the planned objective.
During the planning phase, 
consultation sessions typically aim at sharing information and documenting inhabitants’ proposals in a transparent manner. In later phases, the aim might be to engage stakeholders and inhabitants to exchange views and suggestions on mechanisms of implementation, measures to mitigate implementation challenges, and ways of evaluating outcomes.  Participation of as many city inhabitants and stakeholders as possible. 
 Easy access to the venue in terms of time and location.
 Clarification and agreement on instructions for organizing the session, its purpose and whether its results are binding.
 An atmosphere of confidence and safe space to express different opinions; equal opportunities for dialogue.Strengths: Sharing 
of information and more in-depth and detailed discussions are possible.
Weaknesses: 
Difficult to limit the discussions to the main subject matter, rather than discussing secondary issues.
This method might 
be useful during the early stages of discussing the idea of the program/ project and the initial plan before its official adoption.Public Participation25Method of 
participationDescriptionSuccess factors/ Practical tipsStrengths and weaknesses
Surveys and 
questionnairesSurveys and questionnaires are used to obtain further information targeting specific policy issues. The sample respondents should represent the different target groups and field researchers should be trained on how to administer the questionnaire. The sample should represent all target groups.
 The number of questions in the questionnaire should not be too many so that people do not lose interest.
 Field researchers should be trained on how to administer the questionnaire and the quality of their work controlled (e.g. ensure they do not fill out the questionnaires themselves). 
 Use a simple and direct system for data collection and entry.Strengths:  Provides 
clear and accurate information on the subject matter.
Weaknesses:  
The information 
obtained is typically quantitative and may not allow for qualitative analysis. 
This method might 
be useful during the monitoring and evaluation phase. 
Focus group discussionsFocus group discussions usually comprise a limited number of people, about 5-10 persons, who participate in a guided discussion. The facilitator generates the discussion and asks a set of questions, while the rapporteur documents the responses. Invitations to this kind of discussions can be extended to different groups of persons (e.g. males and females), or 
to only one group 
according to the followed approach and the accepted culture. The facilitator should have experience in leading focus group discussions. 
 Decide in advance whether the group will be diverse or homogeneous (e.g. presence of men and women in one group leads to deeper answers while in some circumstances women might refuse to answer in the presence of men. A similar situation may occur if the group comprises managers and staff).
 The discussion should address limited number of questions to secure enough time for answers.
 Having a strategy to deal with unengaged participants.Strengths: Allows 
in-depth discussions and the collection of qualitative data. It is possible to redirect the discussion to ensure focus on the subject matter. 
Weaknesses:  
Logistical difficulty 
and high cost of conducting large number of focus groups, which limit the number of participants.
This method is 
useful for identifying problems, and when there is a need to collect in-depth information. Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities26Method of 
participationDescriptionSuccess factors/ Practical tipsStrengths and weaknesses
Participatory 
designParticipatory design is an urban design and planning model that involves the whole community in designing urban projects. Participatory design aims to narrow the differences in participants’ views and avoid conflicts between them. Moreover, it gives space to marginalized groups to participate in project planning and design.
Community mapping may 
be used as one of the most powerful visual tools for identifying areas of inequality. Societal maps are drawn to clearly present a huge data set and allow greater representation of local areas. Fair and active participation of different groups, especially, that of marginalized groups.
 Clarity 
regarding the budget 
allocated to the urban project under discussion, to allow planning accordingly.
 Provision of necessary information to city inhabitants by organizing awareness sessions prior to the start of the design activities.
 Strong mitigation strategy to deal with possible differences and conflicts between different groups.Strengths:  Allows 
large number of community members to participate and visualize social, spatial and geographical relationships. Ensures that most plans reflect the actual needs of the community. 
Weaknesses: 
Complicated to implement as it requires coordination, negotiation and time. Planners also need to greatly simplify the process including the planning methods and terminology used.
3.3 Implementation challenges
Convincing the opposition 
Proposed city plans and development projects may face opposition, especially from those who might adversely be affected by the implementation of these plans and projects. For example, street vendors, agricultural producers, or traders’ associations may oppose changing the use of a certain area or turning it into a pedestrian zone. In other times, opposition can be political, due to conflicting agendas of concerned government agencies. Occasionally, opposition may come from civil servants themselves for various reasons (inefficiency, precarious employment status, etc.).Public Participation27Arab cities have suggested to address opposition in the following ways:
 Opt for full transparency, clarity and availability of information.
 Inform the public before proceeding to the implementation of plans and projects, rather than after. 
 Involve actors, especially 
the opposition, in consultation sessions and learn about their views and possible 
concerns.
 Consider 
using words like “proposal”, “draft” and other words that do not give people the impression that the 
matter has been decided.
 Avoid making any promises that cannot be realized.
 Use 
websites and social media to survey public opinion and preferences regarding the proposed policies and 
programs. This information can be used as arguments to convince the opposition and justify implementing 
certain measures and policies.
 Form 
a committee of influential persons (e.g. community leaders) to benefit from their expertise on one 
hand, and to convince opposing groups on the other hand.
 Adopt
 compensatory policies, such as establishing funds for compensating the negatively affected 
populations or non-beneficiary groups.
 Establish complaint mechanisms such as a clear petition system.Local development companies in Moroccan cities
Local development companies are responsible for the implementation of local projects. As such, they are required by law to hold regular meetings to ensure public participation at the city level. The municipality owns 51% of the shares of these companies, which ensures that the companies will be held accountable in case of delay and non-adherence to quality standards.
Despite the effective use of social media by local governments in many Arab cities, 
the following points should be noted:
 Not all people have access to electronic means, and so, use of social media may translate 
into the exclusion of some social groups (e.g. the poorest).
 It is possible to lose electronic information if not saved, which impedes accountability. For example, it is advisable to archive inhabitants’ complaints and suggestions.
 Some websites such as Facebook allow what has already been posted to be edited. Hence, it is preferred to document information immediately following publication, to avoid undocumented modifications.Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities28Engaging actors, stakeholders and concerned parties
Sometimes, the parties that are directly concerned, and therefore need to remain engaged and satisfied (such 
as merchants, tourists, agricultural unions, fishermen, etc.) are not interested or unwilling to participate. In this case, some Arab cities have resorted to a number of engagement techniques as follows:
 Highlight potential funding opportunities for projects.
 Establish 
a committee composed of community leaders who are capable of influencing and engaging 
relevant stakeholders.
 In
volve relevant research / academic institutions to draft evidence-based objectives and outcomes of the 
project. 
 Diagnose the current status, with the involvement of all, before planning the project.
 Disseminate 
projects in the form of “proposals” for feedback within a specified period of time (e.g. through 
social media and websites).
 Make use of the traditional knowledge and experiences of local communities, as important actors.
 Establish 
standing committees for marginalized groups that are responsible for ensuring equal opportunities 
and presenting recommendations (e.g. Committee for equal opportunities for women; permanent youth committee).
 Use public 
spaces, such as historical and cultural places, to hold public participation sessions and meetings. 
Such spaces have a positive impact on achieving social inclusion, mitigating conflicts and boosting the sense of belonging. 
 Use creative and innovative tools to simplify information and attract stakeholders.Volunteers’ engagement in local plans, Ras el Metn, Lebanon
Ras el Metn municipality relies on a group of volunteers to implement many of its programs, such as environmental protection campaigns, which allows a greater participation of local communities.Public Participation29Ras el Metn city in Lebanon benefited from 
articles in the law stating that municipal council decisions remain valid for 10 years (in other words, their validity exceed the term of the municipal council). This can help maintain local policies, including public participation systems.
Sharm El Sheikh resorted to establishing an Occupants’ Union, which can require occupants to contribute financially to cover maintenance works and other items agreed upon by union members.Absence of an enabling environment
Changing local governments 
Many times, local government officials adopt 
a public participation system. However, when the term of the local government ends and new elections are held, the new government does not necessarily adhere to the old system. Such a situation can be addressed by seeking to amend related laws to include articles supporting the continuity of adopted local policies.
Limited resources and low financial capacity 
Many local authorities lack the needed financial 
resources. To address this challenge, some municipalities collaborate with civil society organizations and volunteers, and resort to low-cost public participation approaches such as consultation sessions.
Checklist - Implementation phase
 R Ensure balanced representation of all social groups and engagement of concerned 
parties.
 R Engage civil society and private sector organizations.
 R Identify means to convince the opposition.
 R Select method of participation most appropriate to the nature of the policy or program.
 R Consider power relations when inviting different parties to discussion sessions to avoid situations where one party dominates the other. 
 R Ensure that all meetings and discussion sessions take place in suitable places for vulnerable people like women, youth, persons with disabilities, etc.
 R Ensure that sufficient financial resources are available by diversifying partnerships.Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities30

4. Evaluating public participation
Marginalized groups (including women, youth and persons with disabilities, etc.) may suffer from poor participation opportunities and may lack trust in view of the domination of stronger social groups over participation spaces. It is therefore important during the evaluation phase to include indicators that reflect the extent to which marginalized groups have been able to participate effectively, and to actively express their views. Some examples of indicators are provided below.

INFORMATIONToolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities33

Evaluation Implementation Planning Importance
1. Why access to information? 
1.1 The relevance of access to information at city level
Access to information is an essential enabler of urban inclusion and a pre-requisite for effective public 
participation and citizenship. It also contributes to the achievement of good governance principles, notably transparency and accountability. Most Arab states have adopted national laws and policies to regulate information-related issues, such as access to information, privacy, protection of confidential and security information, documentation of information, intellectual property rights, dealing with governmental documents, national information infrastructure, information flows at the local level, and the promotion of information use (see appendix).
However, there is often a lack of executive directives and explanatory regulations that interpret these laws and 
policies, and provide implementation mechanisms. This may lead cities to take actions that impede access to information, such as non-disclosure of permissible information, for a number of reasons such as fear from retribution and to avoid holding civil servants accountable. The bureaucracy of some administrative systems may also restrict access to, and exchange of information, not only between local authorities and inhabitants, but also between the authorities themselves. This breeds an administrative culture of secrecy, discretion and distrust in those who request information. 
Within this context, this chapter provides tips and guidance for planning, implementing and evaluating access to 
information policies and programs in the city. This chapter also explains – based on Arab cities’ experiences – how to achieve inclusive local information systems while benefiting from the national information infrastructure and in coordination with the concerned governmental and non-governmental bodies. Finally, the chapter provides some suggestions on how to develop systems and structures required for the dissemination of data and information to decision makers, development planners, executives, administrative staff, researchers and the general public, to enable them to participate and contribute to achieving the national development goals. 
In big cities, it is preferable 
to establish an information center in each neighborhood 
to facilitate inhabitants’ access to information.Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities35Phases of policymaking 
cycle Benefits of access to information
Planning phase •  Identify the urgent needs of the community in an accurate manner, 
and assess the real scale of the problem, therefore confirming the value of the planned intervention. 
•
 Promote efficiency and quality by ensuring evidence-based program design (e.g. number of targeted individuals in a particular residential area such as refugees, youth, unemployed persons, etc.) and the optimal utilization of available resources.
•
 Seek feedback and test the reactions of inhabitants to controversial programs (e.g. evacuation and resettlement of inhabitants of informal areas) which would enable officials and local authorities to avoid later opposition, and allow inhabitants to participate.
•
 Set accurate and realistic expected outcomes, rather than over-optimistic and unachievable ones that may lead to public frustration later.
Implementation phase •
 Avoid the cost of re-collecting and re-generating information, since the information generated through previous programs – if made available – could be useful and sufficient for the implementation of the contemplated programs.
•
 Ensure continuous feedback from local communities by offering them the chance to express their opinions on the local policy, thus uncovering at an early stage the negative or positive social and economic impacts of the program. 
•
 Improve quality of implementation by promoting collaboration and networking. Indeed, the information made available may help identify parties who have previous experience, a network of useful stakeholders, or resources that will facilitate the implementation of the program. 
•
 Ensure that the plan is on track and overcome implementation challenges through continuous oversight and accountability throughout the implementation phase.
Evaluation and follow-up phase•
 Improve accuracy and value of feedback from stakeholders and those affected by the program.
•
 Conduct an accurate evaluation of the impact of the program on advancing, or otherwise hampering the achievement of local development goals, thus helping to take rational decisions whether to continue the program, modify it or shift to other programs. 1.2 Benefits of access to information according to participating

2. Planning access to information programs
2.1 Understanding the legislative framework governing access to 
information 
City authorities operate within a national legislative framework that governs access to information. The framework includes a set of laws, legislations and public policies that determine the information to make available, how to make it available, and who can have access to it. Being committed to the implementation of this national framework, local authorities must ensure that its articles are clearly and correctly understood. They should also raise awareness about the opportunities and possibilities that the national framework may offer, in order to maximize benefits and avoid personal interpretations that may lead to withholding information for fear of accountability.Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities412.2 Identifying objectives and beneficiary groups
Identifying clear objectives to be achieved through the provision of information, as well as beneficiary groups, 
and assessing the current and future information needs of inhabitants are essential steps that will guide and frame all the phases of the policymaking cycle (planning, implementation and evaluation). The objectives that cities can pursue through access to information policies and programs include the following examples: 
2.3 Identifying information to be made available and the level of 
accessibility
The classification of information and the identification of the level of accessibility are determined during the planning phase. Information may be classified according to level of accessibility into three categories: public information available to a broader circle of people, restricted information available to a narrower group of persons, and confidential information accessed only by officials.Objectives Beneficiary

information
Public informationRestricted 
informationHighly sensitive or private information that is accessible 
only to a specific group with permission from the 
concerned authority.
 e.g.  security information.
Information that is publicly accessible without 
restrictions imposed by any local, national or 
international laws.
e.g. population census, economic data, 
scientific information, etc.  Information that must be protected for intellectual property 
or privacy considerations, and is only accessible to 
specific groups, such as civil servants, or by submitting 
a request explaining any compelling reasons to access 
such information.
 e.g.  salaries, institutional contracts, etc. 
Cities may provide access to different types of information related to local policies, for example:
•
 I
nstitutional information, such as information about the principles and goals guiding the work of the 
municipality, its decisions and general policies (in other words introductory documents presenting the 
municipality). This type of information is usually classified as public information and is often accessible through the city’s website and libraries. Studies and research produced by the municipalities in the context of planning and designing new projects are also often classified as public information. In some cases, these studies are made available only to researchers, either free of charge or against a fee, in which case they are classified as “restricted” information that is available to a specific group only. 
Similarly, some Arab cities may classify information about the municipality projects and budgets as restricted 
information that is accessible only to other governmental institutions or specific groups of people (only project titles may be revealed as public information with no further details on implementation or budgets). However, it is highly recommended to classify this kind of information as public and to provide it transparently, as this will have a positive impact on the implementation of similar future plans and prevent corruption.
•
 Information related 
to investment and tenders, is often classified as public information. It is advisable to 
publish such information through different media (e.g. on the website and as printed documents available in different locations) to provide all interested parties with equal opportunities to apply. It is also advisable to publicly disseminate tender results and project details either on the website, through social media and other communication means, in order to promote transparency and boost trust between inhabitants and officials.
•
 Information rela
ted to services is classified as public information. It is preferable to provide easy access to 
the details of each service (e.g. application steps, required documents, expected duration, cost of service, etc.).Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities43In Nouakchott, Mauritania, individuals 
submit their information requests to the “Citizen Service Office”, which responds within 48 hours of receipt of the application.2.4 Identifying stakeholders
There are many entities and stakeholders 
concerned with access to information, such as: 
•
 National institutions and local administrations 
responsible for the production and management of information;
•
 Consulting firms in charge of data collection and studies;
•
 International organizations and donors supporting the right of access to information; and
•
 Civil society organizations of all kinds, especially those supporting access to information.
The 
participation of stakeholders can facilitate 
information gathering and dissemination (including the simplification of information and its translation into other languages if needed). It is also possible to rely on open-source information such as service maps and mobile phone applications that allow the dissemination of various types of information and the reporting of emergency information such as service disruptions.
Review the stakeholder power analysis matrix available in the “Supporting 
Tools” booklet.The exchange of information 
between national governmental  
institutions and local authorities 
may help in enhancing efficiency and 
quality of service delivery. For example, the data collected by local authorities about the types of residential units in a certain area can be very useful to inform national electricity and natural gas companies.
It is advisable to engage civil society organizations and the 
private sector in facilitating access to information for persons with disabilities and non-Arabic speakers. This can be achieved by developing advanced technological tools such as e-readers for blind persons and e-translators for foreigners.Access to Information442.5 Institutionalization and continuity
Collecting, publishing and updating information is an ongoing and essential process, which may be challenging 
for cities to maintain over time unless it is institutionalized and permanent human and financial resources are allocated. One of the steps to help institutionalization is to establish, approve and circulate a clear and structured framework for the process of accessing information (such as the city’s legal obligation to provide information about its program budget). Some cities (especially big cities) may establish their own specialized information centers, which are mandated to collect and disseminate information.
Checklist - Planning Phase
 RIdentify the human rights and development aspects that access to information 
programs are expected to serve, and use this link to advocate for the program and gain political support.
 RIdentify the legislative local framework governing access to information and ensure that there are no obstacles to the implementation of the program.
 RDefine clear and measurable objectives for access to information and identify the beneficiary population groups.
 RClassify information and specify level of accessibility.
 RIdentify and engage stakeholders.
 RAnalyze the challenges that may hinder access to information and identify means of mitigation.
For an accurate classification of information, it is advisable 
to form a joint committee comprising officials, inhabitants and civil society. The committee should classify types of information and decide on the best dissemination methods. Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities45

3. Implementing access to information 
programs
3.1 Information gathering
The responsibility of gathering information lies primarily with governmental institutions and local authorities. 
Non-governmental organizations, volunteers, and local development partners may also participate in information gathering, especially when data needs to be obtained through field research (e.g. to assess the state of infrastructure in a specific area), or directly from city inhabitants (e.g. through questionnaires).Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities473.2 Information processing and dissemination
Municipalities may need to process the information before disseminating 
it or sharing it with other institutions. Information should be simplified and presented in a language easily understood by inhabitants from different cultures and nationalities. Accuracy and precision of the presented information will prevent any misunderstanding or misuse of information by inhabitants. It is worthwhile to note that many Arab cities are following the trend towards digitization of information (in other words to transform the information into digital form to allow further electronic processing) and its incorporation into digital databases so as to form the institutional memory. This is in addition to the process of archiving the information in institutional and national libraries.
There are two main approaches for disseminating information: a.
 Pro
active dissemination:  Local authorities voluntarily disseminate information publicly without prior 
request. Different methods of dissemination are possible, as shown in the table below. It is important to 
opt for the method of dissemination that satisfies the specific needs of inhabitants and suits their varying capabilities to access information, such as the limited ability of some persons to use technology or understand the language of dissemination (in the case of refugees for instance). It is preferable to diversify the dissemination methods used, especially when the information is of interest to the general public (such as local services), to ensure it reaches the largest number of people. Some Arab cities are using technology to facilitate access to information, such as the installation of touchscreens in advanced service centers. It is also recommended to provide information related to public services through information kiosks located at the municipality premise or in public spaces, or through one-stop shops that allow inhabitants to get full information and the needed paper forms from one location, in addition to electronic portals and institutional leaflets.

restricted information. Applications are channeled to the concerned department at the municipality, which decides whether to grant or refuse the request based on predetermined criteria. The applicant should be notified of the response within a specified time. It is important to adhere to a set of criteria that guarantee the quality of the application process, as indicated below.The city of Sharm El Sheikh provided touchscreens at the City Council premise to enable 
inhabitants to access information automatically without going through bureaucratic procedures. Information kiosks are being established at the governorate level to serve bigger number of inhabitants.Access to Information503.3 Implementation challenges 
In implementing access to information programs, local authorities may face different challenges and 
constraints, be they related to infrastructure, legal framework, available tools and resources, etc. The table below provides some examples raised by participating Arab cities.
Solutions as seen by Arab cities Challenges facing Arab cities
Benefit as much as possible from existing 
national legal frameworks and from international frameworks in case of any national gaps.Access to information is a relatively emerging and sensitive topic (especially for some types of information).
The law should clearly allocate a budget for disseminating local information. In case of lack of resources, it is recommended to use affordable means of dissemination, such as use of social media, and to expand cooperation networks with non-governmental organizations and private sector institutions. Lack of financial and human resources to gather, process and disseminate information, and to make information available in multiple languages so that all population groups can access it (especially refugees and foreigners).
Take advantage of existing open source applications that are free or low cost, and that can be customized by users according to their needs.Lack of technological competences needed to establish and manage a digital information infrastructure on a continuous basis.
If there is no clear law protecting civil servants, form a committee that is responsible for managing information dissemination through collective decisions.Employees' fear of being held accountable if they disclose information. 
Provide sensitive information through official channels using clear and accurate language to avoid misunderstandings; commit to transparency and to correcting wrong information and misunderstandings among inhabitants.Misuse of published information (for example by the press or the opposition), thus causing resentment by the population.In 2015, the electronic portal for civic documents was launched in Casablanca, Morocco, 
to allow inhabitants to request documents at low cost and in short time. The service is provided under an agreement between the Ministries of Interior, Industry and Trade, Investment and Digital Economy, and Morocco Post.Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities51Five social media benefits to municipalities 
1. Instantly notify inhabitants about crises and disruptions in the provision of services
2.

information
Main disadvantages
• Does not reach all population segments, especially those who do not have access to electronic devices, are not able to read, or do not use social media
•
 May not offer the opportunity for live interactions between city officials and inhabitants

4. Evaluating access to information programs
The quality of information systems and level of access to knowledge depend highly on the quality of the 
information in terms of relevance, accuracy and consistency. Achieving quality information requires a strong political will to promote information gathering, updating and regular dissemination efforts. The table below sets out the basic criteria for assessing the quality of information.
The city of Amman, Jordan, uses the “secret shopper” technique to evaluate its services. 
Information quality officers go undercover (as secret shoppers) to information centers to monitor the quality and efficiency of the process of providing inhabitants with information and hearing their complaints.Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities53Indicator Main questions

SPORT
FORYOUTHINCLUSION© Paolo Bona/Shutterstock.comSport for Youth Inclusion571. Why sport for youth inclusion? 
1.1 The relevance of sport for youth inclusion at city level 
Youth constitute a large segment of the population in the Arab region, with 60% of the total population being 
under 30 years of age.1 Youth as a social group are active in public life, and have the capacity to innovate 
and the will to make a difference. As such, they should be perceived as key partners in the development and implementation of local plans and the achievement of sustainable development. 
Youth inclusion in urban life is a major challenge for most cities in the world, and 
especially for Arab cities. This challenge is a result of the limited capacities of local authorities to tap on youth potentials, provide safe spaces for their effective city-level participation, and develop a discourse that meets their interests and acknowledges their role and contributions. Indeed, local governments often find it difficult to communicate positively with youth and to design programs that enable their engagement in society. This is especially the case given that youth are among the groups that are most affected by deteriorations in economic and social conditions, which often lead to limited education and employment opportunities and increase exclusion and inequalities. 
Sport is a favored tool for local governments to integrate children and youth. There is abundant literature on 
the importance of sport as an entry point for achieving social inclusion. Sport programs provide a platform to raise youth awareness on various issues, such as education, health and labor market, and a safe space for young people to participate actively. Sport is a fundamental right endorsed by the United Nations. Several Arab countries have also endorsed sport in their constitutions and laws, such as Morocco and Iraq. This stems from the belief that sport can play an important role in achieving development, building inclusive cities and local communities, empowering women, youth, individuals and communities and reaching the desired goals of health, education and social inclusion.
However, achieving inclusion through sport is neither easy nor spontaneous. If not properly planned, 
implemented and evaluated, physical education and sport plans and programs may reproduce existing patterns of social exclusion. Some of the facets of this problem include, for example, the high indirect costs of sport (e.g. cost of sportswear and sports equipment) compared to the purchasing power of marginalized and poor communities; difficulties in accessing designated sports areas; gender inequality in accessing sports services; lack of necessary public funding for the expansion of sports projects; and the inability to provide efficient and continuous management of sports and physical education centers.

• Prevention of intolerance, racism, hatred and violence through youth inclusion, especially the mar -
ginalized, refugees and persons with disabilities, and creating a friendly social space for them where they feel safe, equal and not discriminated against.
•
 Promotion 
of gender equality and empowering women and girls by encouraging equal participation 
and equal opportunities for all.
•
 Elimination of extremism, 
violence, drug addiction , and other threatening behaviors to the society by 
engaging youth in sports activities that include awareness raising campaigns.
•
 Improvement 
of education, since physical education exercises improve mental health, cognitive de-
velopment and personality development. 
•
 Enhancement 
of self-confidence, self-fulfillment and character building, in addition to learning key 
values in sports, such as teamwork, fair play, respecting rules, cooperation, discipline, and tolerance which all lead to social cohesion.

2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 
Sport for inclusion supports the achievement of several Sustainable             
Development Goals, especially SDG 3 “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”, with sport and physical activity being an essential  pillar of healthy life. Sport also contributes to realizing SDG 4 “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”, as it can contribute to achieving quality education and may be used to educate youth and adolescents on positive values, skills and behaviors. Sport programs directly contribute to achieving SDGs 5 and 10 by empowering women and girls and reducing inequalities between different social groups.
Sport programs for youth inclusion are also linked to SDG 16 “Promote peaceful and inclusive societies”, as sport plays a great role in consolidating peaceful coexistence between groups and the value of resorting to the rule of law in conflict resolution. Sport is a recommended tool of recovery from the scourge of wars and armed disputes and can contribute to restoring cohesion and re-building confidence between various parties.
New Urban Agenda 
The New Urban Agenda emphasizes in several of its articles on the importance of providing safe, green and multi-purpose public spaces to encourage communication and social interaction and inclusion.
Article 37: “We commit ourselves to promoting safe, inclusive, accessible, 
green and quality public spaces […], that are multifunctional areas for social interaction and inclusion, human health and well-being, economic exchange and cultural expression and dialogue among a wide diversity of people and cultures, and that are designed and managed to ensure human development and build peaceful, inclusive and participatory societies, as well as to promote living together, connectivity and social inclusion.”Commitment #8:

Solutions:
• Convince the Maronite Patriarchate, the largest landowner in the city, to donate a plot of land 
to the project.
•
 Mobilize funding from businesspersons and investors. 
•
 Establish a profit making gymnastics club in the village to fund other free activities

programs
2.1 Setting detailed objectives
Setting detailed objectives helps in articulating a clear vision and using suitable language to define the 
project idea and draft its plan. This may help in gaining support from local, national and international bodies, particularly donors, especially if the project promotes existing strategic development agenda. 
The objectives that cities can pursue through sport for inclusion programs and projects comprise the
  
following examples:•
 Inclusion 
of youth from all sects, religions, races and political groups, allowing them to participate and 
express their opinion as active partners, not only as a target or as beneficiary group in the projects. 
•
 Geographical outreach to all regions, especially marginalized and underprivileged areas.
•
 In
clusion of marginalized groups such as people with disabilities, internally displaced persons, 
migrants and refugees.
•
 Close the gender gap and promote equality between men and women, boys and girls.
•
 Ensure the right to protection and physical security, and combat extremism and riots.
•
 Achieve social 
cohesion and promote behavioral values by integrating excluded groups (e.g. autistic 
persons) in sport activities that fight stereotypes and social stigma. 
2.2 Assessing feasibility of implementation
Arab cities consider the following pre-conditions as necessary for a successful implementation of sport for 
youth inclusion plans and programs:
•
 A

2.3 Evaluating youth inclusion in sport programs 
In order to ensure achieving the objective of youth inclusion through sport, it is recommended, during the planning phase, to assess the status quo by answering the following questions:
•
 To what extent do youth enjoy their rights in economic, social, cultural, civil and political spheres? 
•
 Is 
there a platform for youth to express their opinions and ideas on how to resolve certain issues in 
their societies? Is there a clear communication channel between youth and policy-makers in the city?
•
 Does 
the status quo allow the implementation of inclusive sport programs or are there social tensions 
that may further complicate the situation?
•
 Are there specific sport activities that may increase/ ease the social tensions?
•
 Are there excluded youth in the society? Why? How could they be included?
•
 Which community leaders are accepted by youth and are in harmony with different groups? 
•
 What are the needs of the city or local community for similar projects?
•
 What 
are the favorite sports for youth? How and where are they played? Do they promote inclusion 
and equality? Are there success stories in this area?
•
 What 
are the means to encourage youth participation in sport? How many youth are among the target 
beneficiaries?
•
 Does race or social class influence the type of sport being played?
•
 What 
are the existing disabilities? How does society perceive people with special needs? To what 
extent are they accepted in society?
•
 How does society perceive refugees? Are they perceived equal and accepted in society?

project? Is it acceptable that girls and boys play sport together?
•
 What 
were the results of previous similar projects? What are the lessons learned and which could help 
in predicting consequences and expected challenges and opportunities?Sport for Youth Inclusion652.4 Identifying stakeholders and planning for their engagement 
According to the experiences of participating Arab cities, benefits of engaging stakeholders include   
 the following:
•
 Access 
the wider pool of resources brought in by different stakeholders. This is especially important 
if there are insufficient resources in the Municipality to implement costly sports projects. 
•
 Benefit 
from diverse technical expertise and knowledge and get professional support in information 
gathering and effective planning.
•
 Identify 
popular sports among the target youth as a prerequisite for attracting them to participate in 
the project.
•
 Promote participation as a fundamental value of citizenship, raise the community’s sense of 
 
ownership 
of the project and benefit from youth potentials and civil society organizations’ activists to 
serve project objectives.

their implementation 
• F orm a team  to include diverse expertise covering different technical disciplines as needed.  
For instance, a sport for youth inclusion program may require a team that includes an engineer with 
expertise in the establishment of sports facilities, a coach with expertise in technical sport issues, as well as economic and educational professionals with expertise in designing low-cost social  
inclusion sport programs. 
•
 Identify a 
mechanism to receive complaints and proposals, and to enable reporting  on cases where 
harm has been inflicted upon marginalized or excluded individuals during their participation in sport programs.
•
 Design sport 
programs that adopt social inclusion approach by involving technical experts special -
ized in social, pedagogical and sports issues and working collaboratively to design programs that aim at protecting the social fabric and promoting the principles of unity, equality, coexistence and other concepts.
Idea behind the initiative:
• Establish basketball teams in schools that are open to all students and focus on inclusion 
as a social goal instead of technical skills and sport competition standards.
Challenges:
• Difficulty of obtaining administrative approvals. 
•
 Recognizing Al-Amal sport teams as official teams. 
Solutions:
• Benefit from the concept of “training clubs”, defined in Moroccan law as a broad, flexible concept, and consider Al-Amal teams as school-affiliated training clubs.
•
 Delegate the evaluation of players’ performance and the selection of talented players to the Sports University, as mandated by law.
Institutionalization:
• A three-year agreement between government partners and Al-Amal Club (at the local level) was signed to institutionalize the use of school playgrounds, and mobilize the support of physical education teachers to form sports teams open to all students.Sport for Youth Inclusion692.6 Institutionalization and sustainability according to

Arab cities’ experiences
Limited financial resources available 
to municipalities, compared to the high cost of this type of programs, which require physical resources such as infrastructure and lands.• Utilize budget surplus (if allowed by the local government system).
• Mobilize funds from businesspersons who have interest in the project’s idea.
• Provide incentives for the private sector to invest in the project, such as free use of public advertising spaces (billboards) around the project’s facilities or tax credits under social responsibility.
Lack of necessary conditions for good planning; inability to control many political and economic factors; lack of expertise required for strategic planning in some municipalities.
• Cooperate with consulting firms or research centers to conduct the studies needed to guide the project, and estimate the required duration and resources.
• Exchange experiences among different Arab cities, and benefit from existing networks and coalitions to explore Arab and international practices.
• Involve donors (if any) in the design of plans and programs.
Scarcity of urban lands available to establish sports projects; existing lands are not under the authority of the municipality; lack of available lands in proximity to poor neighborhoods where target groups reside, and which are often overcrowded; high transportation cost in case sports centers are located outside the city.• Establish stadiums and sports projects in adjacent lands on the outskirts of the city (providing adequate transportation remains a challenge).
• Collaborate with individuals or entities that own adequate lands to host the project.
• Utilize existing facilities, such as school playgrounds or gardens affiliated to governmental authorities, NGOs, or youth centers, or rehabilitate facilities for this purpose. 
• Sign cooperation agreements with private clubs to provide their facilities to the public within certain times against certain returns. 
Lack of awareness of the importance of sports programs in achieving social inclusion, thus awarding them poor endorsement and weak political support, and considering them as low priorityin strategic plans.
• Highlight the links between the project and global development goals and agreements, political promises, and national and local plans.
• Develop informational and multimedia materials about the project’s sport and social objectives and the expected social and health returns. Material should present the information in a brief, simple, and innovative manner.
• Cooperate with trusted community leaders, artists, and athletes to increase awareness and attract different segments of society.
• Build partnerships with key community players to provide the necessary funding and material resources.Sport for Youth Inclusion71Planning challenges according

inclusion programs 
3.1 Implementation methods
Method Points of strength
Regular programs in social and 
sports centers,  such as youth 
centers, sports associations and clubs, social centers, and university and school playgrounds. • Long-term strategy to engage youth (especially the  
marginalized) through the organization of regular sports activities that are of interest to them and convenient to their social and cultural context.
• Enhance youth benefit and inclusion by giving them  
the space to participate in the selection, design and  
implementation of sports programs in cooperation  
with the centers’ management boards.
Sports activities for all, organized in public spaces,  such 
as unutilized public lands and neglected gardens.• Overcome the challenge of land scarcity and the difficulty of space allocation to implement sports programs.
• Allow all segments of society to participate in  
the activities.
Occasional, awareness raising sports activities,  such as running 
and cycling marathons typically organized in streets or by the beach to celebrate specific events.• Raise awareness on different social issues like peaceful coexistence, peace building and equality.
• An opportunity to involve all segments of society in one place to support a common cause with limited risks of discrimination, bullying, or exclusion.Evaluation Implementation Planning ImportanceToolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities763.2 Physical structures and qualified human resources  
The physical structures available to the project, such as facilities, infrastructure, and sports equipment should 
be compatible with the target groups’ needs. For instance, sports spaces should be safe, accessible and should meet the basic standards of security and safety especially for refugees and girls. While practicing the sports activities, youth should feel safe from any sort of danger, be it physical (playing dangerous sports or deficiency of equipment due to lack of maintenance) or emotional (peer bullying). 
Thus, it is necessary to ensure qualified human resources having the necessary technical expertise and 
knowledge by undertaking the following steps: 
• Ensure that sports coaches are aware of youth issues and appreciate the importance of their  
mental and physical health and inclusion in society. Additionally, sports coaches should acquire  
the expertise of designing sports programs that have a social dimension and aim to educate youth on certain social values such as positive engagement, leadership, social responsibility and other values that lead to social inclusion. 
• Train civil servants on how to supervise sport programs that aim at youth inclusion, and how to  
manage these programs efficiently, monitoring and improving their implementation when necessary.
• Train the program team on a set of skills and technical knowledge to reach the desired impact  
of the program. Training may address topics such as, but not limited to, youth inclusion,  
physical education, gender and human rights.
• Train all concerned direct and indirect parties of the program on crisis management and provide them with the basic first aid training, in addition to other relevant topics. 
In the framework of good 
governance, government is not seen as the sole party 
responsible for implementation, which depends on the collective efforts and the resources mobilized by all parties and stakeholders, including the private sector and  
civil society.3.3 Communication with the 
public and ensuring youth participation  
It is necessary to develop a communication plan to announce the program, and to communicate with the targeted groups and the public in general to raise their awareness regarding the objectives of the program, share information about achieved results, encourage them to take advantage of the services provided, and maintain their interest and support, thus ensuring the sustainability of the implemented policies and programs. This can  
be done using social media, public billboards,  
with a focus on those located in marginalized areas, newspapers, television and radio. Despite developing a good communication plan and  
creating the necessary awareness, youth may  
still face obstacles to their participation in  
sports programs. Examples of these obstacles and means for overcoming them are provided  
in the table below.Sport for Youth Inclusion77Obstacles to youth participation  Proposed means to overcome obstacles
Youth are preoccupied with studying, 
working or meeting their basic needs (housing, food, etc.). • Consult with youth at the beginning of the project to coordinate activities according to their schedules and commitments.
• Establish partnerships with organizations that secure  
the basic needs of underprivileged individuals and  
internally displaced persons and ensure that youth  
have information about nearby service providers.
Language and other communication obstacles (e.g. refugees speaking their native language only, or not being able to read or write because they dropped out of school).• Train employees and trainers on intercultural communication and dialogue skills and ask for the support of interpreters when necessary. 
• Ensure the presence of staff and trainers in the team  
who speak the language of youth (especially if they include refugees). 
• Use drawings, paintings and illustrative means and avoid the use of written materials (such as consent forms)  
especially in poor areas where there is a possibility  
of high illiteracy rates.
Staff and trainers holding negative attitudes towards youth.• Build trainers’ capacities on life skills, development  
concepts, and human rights and how to use sport as a tool for youth inclusion and achieving social cohesion.
Difficulties of access for people with disabilities.• Select easily adaptable activities appropriate for persons with disabilities.
• Choose accessible locations and reduce environmental barriers that may hinder accessibility.
Girls being discouraged from participation in sports programs  (by parents or the girls themselves) out of fear of bullying or harassment.• Invite parents to participate and/or monitor the activities and attend program celebrations (extend formal written invitations, which can have a positive psychological effect on the parents). 
• Organize information sessions for parents (and the wider community) on the benefits of sport on the physical and mental health of girls, in addition to orientation sessions to share information about the program, listen to their concerns and reassure them.
• Provide a safe space for girls with separate facilities for boys and girls, including changing rooms, bathrooms  
and others.
• If needed, set different sport activity times for girls and boys, provide female trainers, and allow girls to play in comfortable or culturally appropriate clothing.Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities78Objectives:
• Engage youth in the preservation of Ras el Metn’s natural resources and its cultural 
heritage and build their capacities to become local guides and trainers on various sports activities. 
•
 Raise youth environmental awareness through organizing sports activities in public natural spaces, such as hiking in nature, biking and motorcycling, mountain climbing, etc. 
Enabling conditions:
• Political support to the project.
•
 Support and participation of civil society organizations in the implementation.
•
 Availability of open natural spaces to host project activities.“Homat Al-Hima” (protectors of the land), Ras el Metn, Lebanon
3.4 Implementation challenges 
Implementation challenges according to participating Arab cities’ experiencesArab cities’ suggestions and tips to overcome challenges 
Implementing institutions and entities have different visions and work techniques, and coordinate poorly, in addition to bureaucracy that consumes time and resources.
• Understand existing institutions and how to manage collaboration.
• Identify responsibilities clearly in the plan of action, and adopt a flexible approach in distributing tasks during implementation.
• Share with all parties and on a regular basis,  
updates on the progress of implementation and  
the challenges faced, and seek their approval of  
the implementation process. 
• Sign a memorandum of understanding or a joint agreement, identify the local authority entrusted with implementation, and specify the roles of each party in a clear, accurate and detailed manner.
• Use innovative methods of communication to interact and share information and updates, such as creating a “WhatsApp” group that includes representatives of all stakeholders to facilitate communication and response wherever possible.Sport for Youth Inclusion79Implementation challenges according to 
participating Arab cities’ experiencesArab cities’ suggestions and tips to overcome challenges 
Lack of institutional capacities and resources at the local level, independently from the central level authority, and conflict over the ownership of programs and projects between local authorities and national bodies specialized in sport and youth (e.g. land ownership). • Increase resources available to municipalities and local level institutions through partnering with  
various funding agencies like international and  
regional donors and the private sector.
• Design programs to develop the capacities of  
local authorities.  
• Promote decentralization policies and advocate  
for necessary legislative changes in this respect. 
• Adopt innovative thinking through the re-use of  
available local resources, rely on in-kind rather  
than financial support, and engage more volunteers. 
Not committing to the planned timeframe (especially by engineering offices)/slow or no response to new developments. • Regular monitoring and follow-up to urge parties to commit to accuracy and credibility in implementing the tasks. 
• Evaluate achieved progress on a regular basis,  
not only at the end of the project, by conducting  
regular meetings with stakeholders and partners  
to update them on the status and follow-up on  
their responsibilities. 
• Maintain flexibility and the ability to respond to  
unexpected changes, and provide an agreed  
mechanism to modify the plan if necessary.
Public reluctance to participate in the sport program/ difficulty reaching the target groups. • Develop innovative methods to reach and attract  
the public (e.g. public events supported by celebrities or public figures, incorporate arts and entertainment activities within the program). 
• Provide a platform for beneficiaries to express their opinions and to improve the program to meet their needs.
• Adopt a participatory decision-making approach for enhanced ownership, as a fundamental prerequisite for the continued interest of the public in the project.Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities80Objective:
• Establish sports centers in various areas of the city, and make them accessible free of 
charge to all those wishing to practice sports.
Enabling conditions:
• Political, technical and financial support to the centers.
•
 Local authorities hold the overall management responsibility of the centers, in addition to covering all financial costs including wages of coaches and administrators, sportswear for the youth and training equipment.
•
 Sports coaches have the technical expertise to deal with disadvantaged groups, such as refugees, disabled persons and others.Pioneers Centers, Amman, Jordan
An opportunity or a challenge? 
Some local authorities have established institutions outside the governmental structure to facilitate  
implementation of programs. These are public-private and/or civil society institutions such as  
associations and companies whose shares are owned in whole or in part by the municipality.  
Why is this practice an opportunity?
Most city officials and staff consider that bureaucratic hurdles affect the efficiency of program management. 
Hurdles include difficulties in getting updated statistics, conducting surveys to identify needs, and obtaining the approvals and permits needed to buy facilities and equipment. Accordingly, municipalities resort to inde -
pendent entities that do not necessarily adhere to the conditions and procedures of the government bureaucra -
cy, which may be considered an opportunity for the following reasons:
1.
 Facilitate work during various stages of implementation.
2.
 Achieve efficiency and reduce the timeframe for implementation.
3.
 Enjoy greater flexibility in cooperating with the private and non-governmental sectors.
Why is this practice a challenge?
While there is a tendency to focus only on the negative aspects, bureaucracy has positive aspects that should 
not be ignored. Seeking to overcome bureaucracy by establishing institutions outside the governmental  
structure may lead to the following negative impacts:
1.
 Abs
ence of checks and balances on the use of public finances and resources, and on the legality  
of procedures.
2.
 Incompatibility 
with the State’s development goals and visions. Ideally, all public projects should serve 
the overall economic and social development plan of the State and its strategic goals.
3.
 Missing 
the opportunity to reform the bureaucracy and to amend the laws and regulations to  
address pitfalls once and for all, instead of going for temporary fixes for some projects.Sport for Youth Inclusion81Objective:
• P rovide a five-a-side futsal pitch within every residential area in Baghdad to serve low-  
income people and integrate youth, in accordance with the local plan (Article No. 515).
Challenges:
• Securing the land to establish the futsal pitch.
•
 Lac
k of engineering technical skills and financial resources to plan and implement

• Are youth interacting positively with their peers from  
diverse groups?
• What measures have been taken to ensure the participation of girls and women in sports programs? Did it achieve the planned outcomes? 
Achieve socio-economic development goals: promoting values and skills.
• Are the sports programs designed to educate on social and economic development goals including social cohesion, equality for all and respect for the rights of marginalized  
people, refugees, and women, in addition to enhancing skills of leadership, dialogue, cooperation and teamwork, etc.? 
• Have youth acquired the necessary skills to help them play  
an active role in addressing societal problems? Do sports programs contribute to the development and improvement  
of mental and physical health of the participants?Evaluation Implementation Planning ImportanceToolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities84Success indicators Key questions 
Institutionalization and 
continuity: set a model to follow, and establish an institutional approach that supports inclusion in all plans and programs.• Have the key actors in society (government officials, leaders, etc.) been persuaded to prioritize social inclusion on their agendas? 
• Have perceptions and behavior towards sports as a mean of inclusion improved?
• Are the project and its benefits sustainable? Are the sports facilities being maintained?
Review the monitoring and evaluation section in the “Supporting Tools” booklet.
During the evaluation process, 
it is recommended to focus on measuring the results related 
to social inclusion, in addition to results related to sport. Focusing on the latter alone is a common pitfall.CITIZENSHIP 
AND HUMAN RIGHTS EDUCATION
Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities86
© MichaelMSS/Shutterstock.comCitizenship and Human Rights Education87Evaluation Implementation Planning Importance
1. Why citizenship and human rights 
education?
1.1 The relevance of citizenship and human rights education at city level
Citizenship and human rights education is an ongoing, participatory and interactive learning process through 
which people understand their rights and duties towards themselves and others. It promotes the principles of tolerance, coexistence and equality, encourages persons to change their attitudes and behaviors, and enhances their capacity to deal positively with life challenges, including discrimination and exclusion. 
Citizenship and human rights education is part of both formal and non-formal education. In that respect, cities 
play a complementary role to that of schools, as emphasized in international conventions (see section 1.3 below). However, Arab cities face growing challenges in their attempts to reinforce citizenship and human rights, such as the rising conflicts in the region, the resulting numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons, as well as the increasing threat of terrorism. Additional challenges include weak implementation of international conventions and local regulations, economic challenges that limit the ability of local authorities to meet inhabitants’ needs and implement programs on citizenship and human rights, weak social and cultural structures, and the inability to reconcile global principles with local cultural and social traditions.
Educating local authority employees and inhabitants on citizenship and human rights is an essential entry point 
for achieving urban inclusion. Understanding human rights principles and procedures enables local authorities to establish policies and programs that are based on justice, equality (including gender equality) and protection against all forms of discrimination. Such understanding also promotes the active and positive participation of inhabitants in decision-making and their cooperation with local authorities in achieving development objectives. Therefore, every man, woman, young person and child needs to know their rights as humans and understand the limits of these rights and the duties they imply.
An international focus on human rights education 
The World Conference on Human Rights convened in 1993 and drew international attention to 
the issue of human rights education, considering it a "necessity to promote and achieve stable and harmonious relations between local communities and promote mutual understanding, tolerance and peace". The United Nations General Assembly resolution number 49/184, issued in 1994 concerning the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education, reinforced the importance of human rights education. It stated that "human rights education should involve more than the provision of information and should constitute a comprehensive lifelong process by which people at all levels in development and in all strata of society learn respect for the dignity of others and the means and methods of ensuring that respect in all societies".Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities88Citizenship and human rights education programs target knowledge, attitudes and skills  leading to the most 
mature stage of translating knowledge, attitudes and skills into behavior that is practiced in everyday life.
Upholding human rights starts by understanding these rights and knowing 
how they are realized. All members of society (including civil servants, youth, women, children, persons with disabilities, older persons, etc.) should be fully aware of their rights and duties towards their societies as stated in national laws and international conventions.
Once individuals acquire knowledge about human rights, they adopt attitudes that promote human rights and citizenship and refuse negative acts that undermine these rights.Knowledge
Attitudes1.2 Benefits of citizenship and human rights education from the 
perspective of participating Arab cities
 Build  trust between inhabitants and the local authorities:  This is achieved by identifying the rights and 
responsibilities of both parties. As a result, the rights of inhabitants are protected and their duties towards the city are enforced, which eventually leads to building a relationship based on rights, duties and mutual trust.
 Promote the 
principle of common responsibility: This is achieved by identifying all the parties that actively 
promote citizenship and human rights principles, and which include inhabitants, local authorities, local associations and private sector. The rights-based approach emphasizes the importance of individual responsibility and urges each individual to uphold his/her responsibilities towards society.
 Promote cooper
ation between inhabitants and local authorities: This is achieved by changing the behavior 
of inhabitants to become more positive and cooperative with local authorities, in addition to creating an aware and responsible society where each individual enjoys their rights and commits to their duties, thus contributing to the achievement of the adopted development plans’ intended results. 
 Public 
satisfaction with the performance of local authorities: Establishing permanent channels of dialogue 
with inhabitants helps to identify the set of rights that they consider a priority and facilitates the efforts of local authorities to accommodate these priorities within the available financial and technical resources. 
 Develop 
capacities and competences of the city officials:  The success of local authorities’ policies, plans 
and programs related to health, housing, education and other sectors (see appendix 5.A) depends largely and directly on the city employees’ understanding of the principles of human rights and their capacity to uphold them. This stresses the importance of implementing citizenship and human rights education programs to both city officials and residents alike.
 A
chieve progress in terms of global indicators: According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
ensuring that each individual enjoys his/her minimum rights is an indicator of achievement that allows cities to compete globally.Citizenship and Human Rights Education891.3 Citizenship and human rights education and the 
commitments of Arab cities

these meetings, many of the demands were implemented.Citizenship and Human Rights Education95Practical tips from Arab city representatives to promote the continuity of 
citizenship and human rights education programs 
 Distribute tasks clearly between the municipality and other implementing parties.
 Municipality employees who benefit from the education programs must commit to transfer 
the knowledge they have acquired by offering cascading trainings to other colleagues and sharing all training materials.
 Document the programs, for example by preparing training manuals or pamphlets based on the courses implemented by the municipality.
 Conduct regular training of trainers programs benefiting municipality employees.2.3 Identifying stakeholders and concerned parties
 Dire ct beneficiaries: those who benefit directly from the program (e.g. the public or a specific population 
group such as women, youth, immigrants, children, persons with disabilities, etc.).

human rights and methods of teaching these principles to others.
 Activities 
for adults or children (notably marginalized groups) using citizenship and human rights education 
curricula.
2.5 Institutionalization and continuity 
The institutionalization of human rights educational programs may take multiple forms, including the establishment of committees of experts to monitor programs aimed at promoting and protecting human rights, to ensure efficiency and adequacy of the planned programs and considering the human rights dimension. To ensure continuity, it is recommended to incorporate within the program a capacity development component targeting city employees, teachers, and civil society representatives. In addition, media plans need to be developed to advocate for these programs in all local and educational institutions. When undertaking a new project or program, it is necessary to familiarize 
local government officials and the concerned entities with the importance of the project and its human rights aspects.
Objective:  Enhance citizenship, build trust with the municipalities and promote the rights of women, 
children and persons with disability.
Engagement of stakeholders:  Workshops and meetings were held at the municipality, in sports 
clubs, and at the premises of non-governmental organizations, in order to ensure the participation of all concerned stakeholders in designing the initiatives.

rights education programs
3.1 Methods of implementation 
The success of citizenship and human rights education programs depends on selecting the implementation methods most suitable to the needs of the target groups and the financial resources available to the city. It is recommended to follow modern learning methods and to go beyond what is included in citizenship and human rights school curricula. The following are non-exhaustive examples of methods of implementation and the target group for which they are most suitable.Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities100Method Description / examples Target groups

have acquired to their colleagues and relevant target groups by organizing cascading training programs.Local authorities’ staff.
Dialogue forums  Organize frequent dialogue forums with target groups to inform the
m about the implementation steps of 
citizenship and human rights education projects.
 Evaluate target groups’ satisfaction and listen to their proposals for enhancing implementation. All social groups, especially the least represented such as youth, women, and people with disabilities.
Objective: 
Educate youth and children on citizenship using practical and non-traditional learning techniques, and empower them to become future change agents. This is achieved by giving them the chance to participate in city management and to propose solutions to city problems. 
Success factors: 
 The Council is institutionalized within the municipality
 Youth 
and children manage the Council, adopt a transparent election mechanism, and take decisions 
regarding city issues that matter to them.
 An enabling environment supports the initiatives launched by the Council.Children City Council, Amman, Jordan
In case municipalities lack the physical space needed to conduct citizenship and 
human rights education activities, it is recommended to use unexploited historical sites and public libraries. This has the added advantage of contributing to the revitalization of these places. Citizenship and Human Rights Education1013.2 Implementation challenges
Challenge Solutions proposed by Arab cities 
Lack of knowledge and weak 
technical capacity of city staff. Qualified sta ff members are key for successful and sustainable 
implementation. It is recommended to develop a training plan that ensures that city staff (old and new) are able to practice and consolidate the principles of citizenship and human rights in the community.
Opposition to some activities and lack of public acceptance of some messages. Design support and advocacy campaigns to disseminate the main  
objectives and expected impacts of the project using simple language that is suitable for the opposition (e.g. short videos are the best way to deliver messages about human rights). 
 Or
ganize regular community dialogues to share all information in full 
transparency before starting the implementation.
Reluctance of target groups to participate in workshops, especially those addressing sensitive topics. P rovide reassurance guarantees to participants (e.g. in a workshop 
educating women on their right to inheritance, participants were promised that no photo documentation would be allowed during workshops, and that their information would be kept confidential. In addition, information about the trainers and their technical experience in the field was shared in advance with the participants).
Lack of funding.  D esign and implement programs using new technologies and other 
low-cost methods (e.g. television and radio broadcasting are best for delivering messages to a large number of persons. Some cities have the opportunity to use national or local channels free of charge or at low cost. Sometimes also, municipalities cooperate by sharing their advertising spaces).
 Develop
 partnerships with the private sector and international 
organizations to contribute to the funding of different projects.
Changing concepts and behaviors takes a long time and continuous efforts. Design projects with long timeframe and divide project implementation into phases,
 to allow city officials to measure performance after each 
phase and make necessary improvements before moving to the next phase. 
 Include awareness raising media campaigns in all projects.
It is sometimes possible to consider opposition and complaints as a proof of 
success, as they reflect a positive change in people’s behavior in terms of claiming their rights!Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities102Objectives: 
 P rovide an appropriate platform for children's participation in the formulation, implementation, 
tracking and evaluation of local policies.
 Educate children about democracy, citizenship and human rights.
 Establish a culture of dialogue.
 Train children to link responsibility and accountability.
 Provide children with leadership skills.
 Encourage children to give and compete.

Stakeholder power analysis matrix
The stakeholder power analysis matrix determines the extent of power and influence that different stakeholders 
hold over project implementation. The tool is typically used during the planning phase but may also be used during the implementation and evaluation phases. The matrix addresses questions such as the following: Who are the relevant stakeholders to be taken into account? How strong is their impact over the project? What is the best strategy to manage a specific stakeholder? The matrix identifies four types of stakeholders - institutions and individuals - that should be taken into consideration: 1) those with formal authority that entitles them to make decisions; 2) those with authority that allows them to prevent decision-making; 3) those affected by a particular decision; and 4) those who have relevant information or experience.
The two axes of the matrix identify a) the level of power, which reflects the extent to which a stakeholder can 
suspend the project in case they are not satisfied, and b) the level of interest, which means that the stakeholder can influence project implementation and impose changes. For example, if the levels of power and interest are both low, it is simply sufficient to monitor the stakeholder regularly. Whereas if both are high, then a solid and good relationship must be maintained with the stakeholder to ensure completion of the project.

Keep informed Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities112Steps for identifying stakeholders
 Brainstorm to identify all groups and individuals who may affect, or be affected by, the plan / program, while 
making sure to include all groups and individuals.
 D
etermine how organized each stakeholder group is. Some groups may be organized such as Property 
Owners’ Associations, while other individuals may not belong to any organized group.
 Evaluate 
how cohesive each stakeholder group is. Do group members share the same views and interests, or 
are there divisions or conflicts within the group?
 Note 
the type of influence each stakeholder has over the project, and the extent to which project implementation 
depends on the cooperation of a local group or government entity. For example, a party might hold regulatory 
control or the authority over the issuance of needed permits.
 Identify 
the stakes specific to each group or individual, such as economic return / impact, the value system, 
individual ownership, etc.
 Determine the impact of the project on each individual whenever possible.
 It is 
recommended to conduct a number of interviews with a representative sample of stakeholders to test 
assumptions and generate ideas for an effective public participation plan.

60 minutes Opening and 
presentation of the 
proposed programCity official or program focal point introduces key issues and mechanisms of the program.
30 minutes Questions and answers Participants ask questions about what was presented during the earlier session. Questions should seek to clarify points that have been presented, rather than to give opinions or suggestions about the program, as this will be the subject of the following session.
10 minutes Division of participants 
into working groupsDepending on the nature of the proposed program, division into groups may be according to specialization and background, or on the contrary, it may seek to have an equal representation of the participating groups. It is preferable for each group to be composed of a small number of participants (3-5 individuals) in order to allow for in-depth technical discussions.
90 minutes Discussions within the 
working groupsEach group discusses what was presented at the opening session, including points of agreement and disagreement, foreseen challenges and concerns, and recommendations for improvement. 
20 minutes Break
60 minutes Presentations of the 
working groupsEach group presents a summary of the main points 
discussed and raises questions and suggestions to city officials.
60 minutes Open discussion City officials comment on the presentations of the working groups and respond to the questions and suggestions raised.

 Community Engagement Toolkit,
https://www.murrindindi.vic.gov.au/files/assets/public/documents/governance/community-engagement-
toolkit.docThe four success criteria of consultation meetings:
 Only the persons concerned must attend the meeting.
 Collected information, notably proposed ideas and suggestions, must be recorded/ documented.
 Once the meeting ends, side discussions and new ideas must not be permitted.
 The date and time of the meeting must be chosen to suit the timetable of employees and workers.
It is important to ensure that:
 Participants 
are divided into groups. If not, and participants remain in one large group, it is advised to 
sit in a circle where everybody can see the others.
 Participants take turns to speak.
 Necessary tools are provided (paper, pens, flipcharts, etc.) to write down ideas and suggestions.
 Everyone participates and no one is sidelined.
 Equal representation is ensured.Supporting Tools115Monitoring and evaluation steps
Step 1: 
 Inc
lude quantitative and qualitative indicators in the logical framework (logframe). Indicators must be 
“SMART”, in other words Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound. 
 Identify 
data collection methods to measure indicators. These include, but are not limited to, focus groups, 
opinion surveys, questionnaires, diagnosis studies to compare the present status to the previous status. 
Step 2: 
 Identif
y information and data required for evaluation and related data sources (e.g. project participants, 
project staff, and external observers such as civil society).
Step 3: 
 Identify 
and design data collection tools (e.g. interview guide, focus group discussion guide, and rapid 
assessment forms). Note that the included questions should address the aspects that are being evaluated. 
Step 4: 
 Collect the data, store it in a database, and analyze it. 
Step 5: 
 D
raft a detailed evaluation report that presents the logframe measuring indicators and sheds light on 
achievements, challenges, successes, failures, areas of improvement, and lessons learned.
Entities responsible for the evaluation process
 External evaluator or evaluation company
(Pros: experienced, objective. Cons: high cost);
 Internal evaluation by one of the project staff with previous experience in evaluation(Pros: low cost, familiarity with project details. Cons: bias to the project);
 Cooperation with local NGOs to monitor the project(Pros: low cost, objective. Cons: lack of experience in evaluation).3. Monitorin g and evaluation Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities116Success indicators

 Do project staff give 
participants the chance to freely criticize the project/ program? Arab cities are witnessing an unprecedented expansion. Home to more than half of the region’s population, 
Arab cities have transformed into heterogeneous spaces that host diverse identities, cultures, and ethnicities. In order for this transformation to lead to prosperity, city officials must adopt a rights-based, human-centred approach, and implement inclusive policies and measures that provide equal opportunities for all.
In this context, the Toolkit for Urban Inclusion in Arab Cities provides Arab city leaders and local government 
officials with practical tools and advice to guide their efforts towards establishing inclusive and sustainable cities. The Toolkit is based on the real experiences and practices of cities members of the Coalition of Arab Cities against Racism, Discrimination, Xenophobia and Intolerance in planning, implementing and evaluating programs and projects that promote urban inclusion and combat exclusion in all its forms. The Toolkit focuses on four topics of high priority to the Arab Coalition member cities: public participation, access to information, sport for youth inclusion, and citizenship and human rights education.
The Toolkit is a technical reference “from Arab cities, to Arab cities”. We hope that it will contribute, with 
its participatory and practical approach, to the establishment of inclusive Arab cities in line with the 2030  
Agenda for Sustainable Development and the New Urban Agenda.Cities promoting inclusion through public participation, access to information, sport,

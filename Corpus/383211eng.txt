work of advancing the mutual knowledge and understanding of peoples, through all means of mass communication and to that end recommend such international agreements as may be necessary to promote the free flow of ideas by word and image’,
Emphasising the increase in the number of countries that have adopted and are 
implementing constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for the right to access information,

processes, including by promoting informed decision-making, enhancing

Recognising that the right of access to information is closely related to the 
right to know the truth about violations of human rights and of international 
humanitarian law,
Stressing the important role played by independent oversight bodies, such as 
information commissioners, in ensuring implementation of access to information 
legal frameworks,
Acknowledging that information today is increasingly produced, distributed, 
accessed, and maintained in digital form, and that the internet and digital 
platforms thereby play an important role in creating an enabling environment for 
the right to access information,
Expressing concern about the persistent divides in society in terms of exercising 
the right of access to information, to the detriment of women and youth as well 
as indigenous people, persons with disabilities and other marginalised groups,

adopted by the participants of the UNESCO World Press Freedom Day Global

administrative bodies which are endowed with the necessary resources;

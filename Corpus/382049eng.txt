The Universal 
Periodic Review (UPR) 
and its potential to foster 
freedom of expression,  
access to information 
and safety of journalists  
INTRODUCTION
This guide aims to encourage civil society and community 
organizations, activists and individuals to engage with the United 
Nations’ (UN) Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism 
on freedom of expression, safety of journalists and access to 
information issues. The guide explains why it is important to 
focus on freedom of expression in the UPR, followed by an 
overview of the UPR mechanism; a brief introduction to freedom 
of expression; and practical guidance on civil society engagement 
with the UPR. It also provides a set of resources for further 
information on the topics addressed. 
The participation of civil society in the UPR process is key to 
filling in gaps that the other stakeholders’ reports may have. Civil 
society participation ensures that the views of the people on the 
ground are taken into account. The UPR mechanism therefore is a 
unique opportunity for civil society to provide key information on 
human rights issues to an intergovernmental body. ABOUT
These guidelines build upon a 
joint Amnesty-UNESCO survey 
of more than 70 civil society 
respondents from different 
regions; a series of consultation 
webinars held between March and 
June 2022; and comprehensive 
interviews with civil society 
organizations from different 
regions. The survey, available 
in several languages, measured 
the level of engagement of civil 
society with the UPR; coordination 
between organizations; planning 
for advocacy and follow up; and 
enquired about the key challenges 
and needs for NGOs to effectively 
contribute to the process. GUIDELINES FOR

provision of information for the UPR from civil 
society to UN Member States.
United Nations  (UN): an international organization 
created by a Charter  in 1945, currently with 193 
Member States that gather together, discuss common 
problems and find shared solutions that benefit all 
of humanity. Protecting human rights is one of their 
main responsibilities. UN Country Teams (UNCTs) 
coordinate the work of all UN actors in countries with 
UN programmes to support their development needs.

the basis for all other human rights standards. It has 
30 articles, setting out various fundamental rights.
UPR recommendation: a suggestion made by 
one State to another for the best course of action to 
improve enjoyment of a specific human right. GUIDELINES FOR CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS3
1. THE UPR: AN OVERVIEW
What is the UPR?
  The UPR is a cyclical review process of the UN Human Rights Council  (HRC) that began in 2008. 
  It is universal  – it applies to all 193 UN Member States. 
  It is periodic  – States undergo a review every five years. The 4th cycle begins in October 2022 and 
will last until 2027. 
  It is a peer- review  process that involves States reviewing other States’ human rights records and 
being reviewed in turn. 
  It has three main stages: preparation; review and adoption by the HRC; and implementation.
Who reviews?
  All UN Member States can participate in the review and make recommendations, which the State 
under review will either “support” (commit to implement) or “note” (no commitment to implement). 
Each review is facilitated by a “troika” – three States selected by the HRC from its 47 current members 
by the drawing of lots – that is responsible for producing the report of the review. 
What are the standards that States are reviewed against? 
  The review must be based on the following standards: 
  The UN Charter .
  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights  (UDHR).
  Core human rights instruments that the State has agreed to, such as the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights  (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic Social and 
Cultural Rights  (ICESCR).1 
  A country’s voluntary pledges and commitments: any pledges the country made before being 
elected to the HRC;  declarations or commitments made during international meetings; and 
national level policies and programmes.
  Applicable international humanitarian law (IHL).2 
What are the input documents for the review? 
  The national report by the State under review – a 20-page self-assessment of the state of human 
rights in the country.
  Information from UN bodies (including UNCTs, treaty bodies and special procedures) – a 10-page 
compilation by OHCHR.
  Information from “other stakeholders” – a 10-page compilation by OHCHR of information from 
civil society. This is where information from your submission will appear. 
 Who can participate?
  Anyone in your country or the country you are working or reporting on – including 
registered civil society organizations, unregistered groups, concerned citizens, student groups 
and educational institutions, as well as National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) and 
intergovernmental bodies – can make submissions of information, carry out advocacy, comment 
on outcomes and monitor implementation. 
  The UN actively encourages diverse representation in order to get the fullest picture of the human 
rights situation in each country. 
1 When the freedom of expression of particular groups is in the spotlight, for example women, children and people with disabilities, 
specific conventions related to these groups should be taken into account. Treaty ratifications can be found at binternet.ohchr.org/_lay -
outs/15/TreatyBodyExternal/Treaty.aspx
2  IHL is a set of rules relating to armed conflict. This includes the protection of civilians and persons who are no longer taking part 
in hostilities. If a country is involved in an armed conflict, this will also be part of the basis of the review.  THE UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW (UPR) AND ITS POTENTIAL TO FOSTER FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, 
ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND SAFETY OF JOURNALISTS 4
WHY FOCUS ON FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, SAFETY OF 
JOURNALISTS AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION? 
Freedom of expression is what you can say, write, display 
or wear publicly and how easily you can access 
information, including about what a government  
is doing. It is also about associated rights:
  of freedom of association (who you can form 
groups with) and
  peaceful assembly (the right to peacefully gather 
and meet with others, including, for example, during 
peaceful protests.
These are all foundational aspects of civic space that 
is essential for the existence of civil society 
organizations and are enablers for other human 
rights. People on the ground, who understand their 
local context, are the best placed to understand the 
interlinkages between these rights, but, as an 
example, women, minorities, LGBTQI individuals and 
those concerned about sexual orientation or gender 
identity issues, as well as marginalized and at-risk 
communities, may not have equal access to freedom 
of expression or to information. Other rights 
associated with freedom of expression are:
  People’s right to participation in political and 
public affairs such as development (better standards 
of living and quality of life) or governance (how well 
things are run) – this is gravely impacted where there 
is no space for freedom of expression.   Education, environmental, health and labour 
rights – these are adversely impaired in an a context 
that lacks freedom of expression. In the absence of 
freedom of expression and independent media, 
without safety of journalists, it is hard to hold 
governments to account. Freedom of expression also 
plays a key role in the ability of a society to share 
resources equitably. So even if your work is not 
explicitly connected to freedom of expression, you 
can strengthen the impact of your work by including 
this important issue. 
What happens during the review?
  The 3.5-hour interactive dialogue allows 140 minutes for reviewing States to ask questions and make 
recommendations and 70 minutes for the State under review to present its national report and respond 
to questions by reviewing States, either submitted in advance or asked during the review. The State must 
say whether it will support recommendations before the adoption of the review outcome report by the 
HRC about four months later. 
What happens after the review?
  The State is expected to implement supported recommendations by the next review, and you can play 
an important role here in demanding and monitoring implementation. Both you and the State you 
are working on can submit information on progress to the HRC halfway through the cycle through a 
voluntary mid-term report.© Andrea DiCenzo/

2. HOW DOES THE UPR RELATE TO OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS 
MECHANISMS?
The UPR is a human rights mechanism that is led by States and can be affected or influenced by bilateral 
and multilateral relationships and international politics. Other UN human rights mechanisms, such 
the treaty bodies  and special procedures , are independent mechanisms led by experts who may look at 
specific human rights issues in greater detail. Each mechanism possesses different strengths that you can 
use in a complementary manner. UPR outcomes often have greater levels of acceptance among States, 
and the system has a strong persuasive value as a peer review mechanism where a State voluntarily makes 
commitments to implement recommendations. The recommendations under the UPR are not binding, but 
the periodicity of the review allows for the systematic follow-up of implementation. Recommendations from 
Treaty Bodies and Special Procedures can mutually reinforce or build on UPR recommendations and vice 
versa. The Voluntary National Review  of progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
can also be a complementary process to the UPR (see above on the Sustainable Development Goals). 
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), freedom of expression  
and access to information 
Fostering freedom of expression is key to the 
achievement of the 2030 Agenda’s Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) , particularly SDG 16.  Human 
rights are central to all of the SDGs and the Voluntary 
National Review  of progress towards the SDGs can 
also be a complementary process to the UPR. 
SDG target 16.10 aims to “Ensure public access to information 
and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with 
national legislation and international agreements” . Its 
indicators include statistics on attacks on journalists 
(Indicator 16.10.1) and on legal or policy guarantees for 
public access to information (Indicator 16.10.2).You can find useful information for drafting your 
shadow reports in the country specific information 
on safety and impunity within the UNESCO’s 
Director-General’s Reports on the Safety of 
Journalists and the Danger of Impunity , as well as in 
UNESCO’s reports on the World Trends in Freedom of 
Expression and Media Development . 
Data on access to information, with country-level 
relevance, is also available in UNESCO’s annual 
reports on the status of implementation of SDG 
16.10.2 . Figure 1.

3. A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION 
3.1 International standards 
It is useful to familiarize yourself with relevant international and regional standards on freedom of 
expression and access to information for the country you are working on, as the purpose of the UPR is 
to assess whether the national situation complies with these standards. Therefore, the OHCHR requires 
submissions for the UPR to have a human rights framework. 
The right to freedom of opinion and expression is enshrined in Article 19 of both the UDHR and the ICCPR. This 
freedom is also included in other international and regional treaties and declarations,3, 4 as well as in observations 
by various treaty bodies,5 the UN Special Procedures and in various UN reports and resolutions. 
Freedom of expression is key for open civic space and for transparency and accountability. It has also been 
recognized as an enabling right that is essential for society and for the promotion and protection of human 
rights. A State is permitted to restrict the freedom of expression only under very strict conditions.6 The same 
applies to access to information.
3.2 Media freedom, the safety of journalists and access to information
Media freedom is an integral part of freedom of expression and is critical for transparency and 
accountability. A free media can add value to work by civil society organizations and give visibility to civil 
society concerns. Independent journalism is also a strong deterrent against disinformation.
Online platforms and tools for spreading and accessing information have given rise to new categories of 
media workers such as bloggers and community-level actors and organizations that use the internet to 
report and broadcast. These new online and offline media workers are key allies for civil society and share 
the same civic space as civil society actors. However, while social media has opened up space for civil society 
activism and human rights messaging, this has also led to increases in smear campaigns, disinformation and 
hate speech by both state and non-state actors that delegitimize human rights movements and civil society 
actors, not least anyone generating journalism that is uncomfortable for powerful interests. 
One journalist is killed every five days  for bringing information to public attention. Other types of attacks 
– such as threats or arrests and prosecutions – can also threaten their physical safety or limit their ability to 
report. 7 UNESCO’s Observatory of Killed Journalists  provides an overview of killings of journalists by

dures/sr-freedom-of-opinion-and-expression/international-standards
4  International treaties include the ICESCR, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the International Labour Organization Convention 135. 
Regional instruments include the American Convention on Human Rights, the Declaration on Principles of Freedom of Expression by the 
Organization of American States, the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expres -
sion and Access to Information in Africa, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and 
the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration. Relevant regional mechanisms include the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, 
the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights, the European Court of Human Rights, the Inter-American Commission on Human 
Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. More information about regional human rights mechanisms can be found at

country and the status of related judicial inquiries. UNESCO has also documented the specific risks faced by 
women journalists . Further information on the safety of journalists can be found in the Resources section.
The right to freedom of expression includes the right to seek and receive information through any 
medium.8 Access to information is based on the principle that all information held by public bodies should 
be available for disclosure except under restricted conditions where such disclosure may cause harm to 
legitimate aims listed in the law and where such harm outweighs the public interest in knowing.9,10 UNESCO 
provides  a  standardized  approach  to  monitoring  access  to information, which examines the components of 
“adoption” and “implementation” of legal guarantees on this topic, and can be found on UNESCO’s annual report 
on Access to Information . 
The ability of civil society to participate in civic space and 
demand accountability in relation to various human rights 
will be severely reduced when public information is unduly 
withheld. Previous UPR recommendations have linked access 
to information to issues including freedom of expression, 
women’ s and children’s rights, health, education, rights of 
persons with disabilities and the right to privacy. More 
information on the UPR and access to information can be 
found in the Resources section.
3.3 Reprisals
Engaging with the UPR process, and with the UN in 
general, can sometimes make the UPR a risky exercise for 
individuals or organizations who engage with it. Reprisals 
and intimidation are attacks or threats faced by individuals 
or organizations as a result of their cooperation with the 
UN. At their very core, reprisal attacks are an effort to suppress freedom of expression as they aim to stop 
or prevent communication with the UN. Where dissent and criticism of the State are not tolerated, activists 
engaging with the UPR have faced harassment, travel bans, surveillance, arrest warrants and arbitrary 
detention as well as death and physical harm. 
Acts of intimidation and reprisals for cooperating with the UN in the field of human rights is viewed very 
seriously by the UN. The UN Secretary-General compiles information on allegations of reprisals and 
presents them in an annual report to the HRC .
All information submitted to the UPR is publicly accessible online.  Y ou should therefore exercise caution 
and due diligence when submitting information to the UPR process and avoid identifying a place or a 
person if it would pose a danger to them. 
8  Various UN Special Procedures and regional bodies have successively expanded upon this aspect of the right to freedom of ex -
pression. See, for example, UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression, 
18 August 2017, UN Doc. A/72/350.
9  See, for example, UN Human Rights Council resolutions 31/32  and 34/20 .

Journalists and the Issue of Impunity 
The UN Plan of Action on the Safety of 
Journalists and the Issue of Impunity , a 
multi-stakeholder mechanism spearheaded 
by UNESCO, aims to create a free and safe 
environment for journalists and media 
workers. It includes the establishment of 
a UN inter-agency mechanism to handle 
issues related to the safety of journalists; 
assistance to countries to develop legislation 
and mechanisms favourable to freedom of 
expression and information; and support 
for countries’ efforts to implement existing 
international rules and principles. Reporting on implementation

What to do when facing intimidation or reprisals 
Should you face intimidation or reprisals because you engaged with the UPR, and you think it is safe to do 
so, you can contact the UPR Secretariat immediately at uprreprisals@ohchr.org  
Y ou can also bring this information to the attention of others who have faced reprisals. Y ou should only act 
on behalf of others if you have their (or their representative’s) consent to do so. 
Y ou can also:
  Contact the Secretariat at hrcngo@ohchr.org  with information about intimidation or reprisals in 
relation to the adoption of a UPR outcome at the UN HRC.
  Contact relevant UN Special Procedures (in particular, the Special Rapporteurs on the situation of 
human rights defenders and on the protection and promotion of freedom of opinion and expression). 
Information on how to send individual communications to these UN experts can be found here .
  Contact the UNCTs11 or the OHCHR office in the country you are reporting on,12 if there is one, and 
encourage them to use their good offices. 
  Submit the information for compilation in the annual report of the Secretary-General on reprisals. Y ou 
can find how to do this here .
  Submit a complaint to the Human Rights Committee if the country you are working on is party to the 
First Optional Protocol to the ICCPR. Information on how to do this can be found here .
  Highlight cases of reprisals from the previous cycle in your UPR submission and advocacy.
It is very important to make a security and risk assessment in advance, especially if you think reprisals are 
likely. There are different actions you can take to protect yourself or others who face, or might face, reprisals, 
depending on your risk assessment. Front Line Defenders  has toolkits related to safety and security.
Other organizations to get in touch with for assistance are listed in the Resources section.

4.1 Before the review
13  Timor-Leste: Enhancing Equality and Inclusion: Amnesty International Submission for the 40th Session of the UPR Working Group, 
July 2021, amnesty.org/en/documents/asa57/4499/2021/en/This is the preparatory stage. It is best to begin working on 
this stage at least one year – and ideally longer – before the 
review of the country you are working on takes place. 
4.1.1 Submissions 
Y ou can submit information on human rights situations, 
covering the main human rights issues you wish to highlight, 
including any new issues that have arisen since the last review. 
Consider covering freedom of expression, safety of journalists 
and access to information and whether legal frameworks 
and practices related to these rights in the country you are 
working on are in compliance with international standards.
Official guidelines on drafting submissions for the 4th 
cycle are available here . Submission deadlines for “other 
stakeholders”  are scheduled about six months before the 
review. UNESCO has produced  model text  that can be 
considered for a number of freedom of expression and 
access to information recommendations.
Consider pros and cons about how your submission may relate to the national report of the State you are 
working on. Y ou may wish to assert interest in contributing to the official submission; alternatively, you 
may wish to retain your right to make an independent submission. Important to weigh up here is whether it 
would be advantageous or not to make public an advance copy of your submission (for example, in the light 
of safety and security issues). Additionally, if you decide to publish in advance or alongside its publication 
on the OHCHR UPR website, it is useful to assess whether to do so before, after or coinciding with the 
publication of the State’s national report.
4.1.1.1 Technical requirements
The OHCHR requires that submissions should: 
  Highlight progress since the last review, including implementation of 
previous recommendations. 
  An example of an Amnesty International submission with a 
completed matrix can be found here .13 
  Y ou can make reference to progress on freedom of expression 
where it intersects with other issues even if you don’t have space 
for a dedicated section.
  Suggest or reiterate SMART recommendations reflecting good practices (see below 
for more information on drafting SMART recommendations). 
   Provide credible and well-documented information, backed up by first-hand evidence 
or from independent sources. 
  Avoid referencing reports by other governments as this will lead to your 
submission being rejected by the OHCHR.
  When using first-hand information, be as detailed as possible to increase credibility 
(bearing in mind potential risks of reprisals).TOP TIP
This can be done easily 
by providing comments 
in the OHCHR matrix of 
recommendations from 
the previous review that is 
available from the relevant 
OHCHR UPR country page .Tips on working with partners
The OHCHR actively encourages civil 
society to work in partnership or coalition 
when engaging with the UPR. Some issues 
to consider if you are planning to work in 
partnership with others include:
  Research the background of those you 
might work with to understand what they 
work on and to check that working with them 
will not cause you any reputational issues.
  Plan carefully to avoid 
misunderstandings:
 Before you start, consider writing 
down what you both expect from the 
partnership and what you will each do 
at the various stages.
 Keep each other informed of 
developments at all stages.
 Talk afterwards to discuss what went 
well and what didn’t to learn how to 
work together better next time. THE UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW (UPR) AND ITS POTENTIAL TO FOSTER FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, 
ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND SAFETY OF JOURNALISTS 10
 Do not use abusive language.
 Do not exceed 2,815 words (or 5,630 for joint submissions), excluding endnotes and annexes.
 Write in one of the six official UN languages.
4.1.1.2  Dr afting recommendations 
Y ou can use suggested recommendations from your submission for 
advocacy with recommending States. Effective recommendations:
 are well substantiated by credible and reliable information in your
submission, ideally your own or from reliable, independent sources that
must be referenced;
 are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound
(SMART);
 reference relevant UPR recommendations from previous cycles and
from other human rights bodies;
 are written in simple and concise languag e:
 easily understandable recommendations have a better chance of
being picked up.
4.1.1.3  M apping past recommendations 
Look at past UPR recommendations made to both the country you are 
reporting on, and to other countries. 
This will help:
 identify which States to target for your advocacy as there may b e
patterns of issues that certain recommending States are intereste d in;
 work out whether previous recommendations could still be used, or if they need to be changed.
4.1.1.4  F actoring in political change 
Political change in a country can disrupt progress achieved in previous UPR cycles. Freedom of expression 
along with freedom of association and of peaceful assembly are acutely sensitive to such developments and may see drastic change.
Coordinating submissions 
Advocacy is most likely to be successful if it is 
coordinated with partners. You can:
Reach out to partners to coordinate who willcover which issues.
Join or form a national UPR coalition.
Join a joint submission.
You can make your own submission and joinany number of joint submissions. This couldbe a way to lend your voice to concerns aboutfreedom of expression while focussing onyour priorities in your submission.Encourage and/or partner with journalists ormedia organizations to submit information.
See, for example, joint submissionsby Amnesty International and mediaorganizations on freedom of expression onIndonesia and South Africa.
Encourage information commissions, informationombudspersons as well as press councils to alsosubmit information.TOP TIPS
Read through the 
recommendations made 
by the State under review 
to other States to see if they match any of the 
recommendations you 
plan to suggest. It is harder for a state to reject 
recommendations that are 
similar to those that it has made to other States.
Amnesty and UNESCO have 
produced separate guidance 
on how to draft SMART 
recommendations that you may find helpful.
TOP TIP
It is easy to search the UPR Info database of 
recommendations, which 
has options to search for recommendations related to 
freedom of expression and 
by country. GUIDELINES FOR CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS11
 If this happens in the country you are reporting on:
  highlight this change and add any new areas of concern to your submission; 
  analyse any backsliding on implemented recommendations and suggest appropriate recommendations.
4.1.1.5 Think about prevention 
If the human rights situation in a country is deteriorating, or you expect it to deteriorate, consider 
suggesting recommendations that involve preventive steps. This could also allow for UPR follow-up to be a 
useful monitoring and benchmarking exercise during difficult times.
4.1.2 Advocacy 
Planning an advocacy strategy before the review will help you maximize the 
impact of your UPR engagement efforts. 
Since only States can make recommendations during the review, 
reaching out to reviewing States enables you to try to influence their 
recommendations to reflect your priorities. Embassies in national capitals 
and permanent missions to the UN in Geneva, as well as foreign ministries 
of States with influential relationships with the country you are working on, 
are all important advocacy targets to consider.
This preparatory phase is also a key moment to engage directly with the 
country you are working on, to encourage it to address critical issues in its 
national report and to be open to important recommendations. Reaching 
out to the media will help raise visibility and increase the effectiveness of 
advocacy efforts. 
  Foreign ministries of recommending States prepare their 
recommendations well in advance of the review. Reaching out to embassies in the country you are 
working on and to permanent missions in Geneva months ahead will increase your chances of being 
able to influence their recommendations. 
  Early advocacy will also give you a better chance to influence the national report of the country you are 
working on and its position on recommendations.
For example:
  Create a one-page summary of the submission.
  Produce factsheets on your key issues with relevant recommendations – you could produce one on how 
your work is affected by the freedom of expression situation in the country you are working on.
  Click here  for examples of factsheets from UPR Info. 
  List all the recommendations from your submission in a shorter document (diplomats have told 
Amnesty International that the recommendations are particularly important for them). 
  Click here  for an example of an Amnesty International document containing only 
recommendations. 
4.1.3 How to approach National Consultations 
Though not mandatory, States are recommended to consult with civil society ahead of the review. With this 
in mind, NGOs can: 
  Request a consultation with the government. TOP TIPS
Plan  to engage in advocacy 
at least six months before the 
review of the country you are 
working on takes place.
Re-purpose  the UPR 
submission for advocacy 
purposes. Concise, easy-to-
read documents are more 
likely to catch attention!
This is an opportunity  to 
revise your recommendations 
if things have changed since 
you wrote your submission 
or to add additional ones, 
including on freedom of 
expression.  THE UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW (UPR) AND ITS POTENTIAL TO FOSTER FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, 
ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND SAFETY OF JOURNALISTS 12
  Ask the National Mechanism for Reporting and Follow-up (NMRF) (if one 
exists) for a consultation.14
  If there is one, request the UNCT, OHCHR field presence or UNESCO 
field office in the country you are working on15 to facilitate engagement 
and consultation (with or without the government) and to discuss issues of 
common interest.
  Highlight any lack of consultation in your UPR submission and 
advocacy.
  Organize your own inclusive consultations with partners such as civil 
society organizations, including media, grassroots organizations and 
community activists, NHRIs, parliamentarians and universities to 
coordinate submissions and advocacy objectives. 
  Consider inviting officials responsible for freedom of expression in the 
country you are working on, such as the Information Commission or 
media regulatory or self-regulatory bodies (for example, a press council).
  Organize public events to generate discussion about progress on human 
rights and invite journalists and government officials.

4.1.3.1 Conduct a risk assessment and plan for potential reprisals from the outset
If you fear reprisals, conduct an assessment early on and develop a security 
plan. If you have consent to do so, include information on any such 
attacks in your submission and in your advocacy (keeping in mind that all 
submitted information is public and should not cause further harm).
4.1.3.2 Advocacy opportunities before the review
There are many advocacy opportunities for civil society, and you can 
consider which of these are most useful for you, depending on your capacity 
and resources and what you think will be most relevant in the local context 
of the country you work on.
  Share your submission with the government and ask for a meeting to 
discuss it:
  Click here  to access a model letter for sending your submission.
  Share your advocacy material and organize briefing meetings (on your 
own or jointly with partners) well in advance with:
  embassies in the country you are working on; 
  diplomatic missions in Geneva. Click here  to access a model 
letter that can be adapted for embassies or diplomatic missions in 
Geneva.
  Organize a public event (“side event”) in Geneva.

15 A list of UNESCO field offices is available at: en.unesco.org/fieldofficeTOP TIPS
Ask these UN bodies if they 
have capacity-building 
resources if you think you or 
other people could benefit.
Civil society 
recommendations with 
multiple endorsements in 
different submissions are 
more likely to be picked up in 
the OHCHR compilation and 
by recommending States.
Be careful to ensure that 
the consultations that you 
organize are not used as an 
excuse by governments not 
to hold their own!
TOP TIPS
UPR Info organizes meetings 
(“pre-sessions”) ahead 
of UPR sessions to brief 
diplomatic missions on 
civil society concerns in the 
States coming up for review. 
Information  on how to 
apply can be  found here .
Think  about the most 
effective timing for your 
event. Diplomats’ attention 
will be focussed on the 
UPR in the two months 
ahead of the review and 
they may be distracted 
by other issues during a 
HRC session. On the other 
hand, if the country you are 
working on is already on the 
agenda of a HRC session, 
you could piggyback on this 
opportunity and organize a 
side event. GUIDELINES FOR CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS13
4.2 During the review and adoption
The review is a 3.5-hour interactive dialogue between States. A summary outcome document is released two 
days after the review. States have two weeks to make editorial changes. It records comments made, the State 
under review’s responses, and all the recommendations made. 
The State under review must say which recommendations it supports at a HRC session about four months 
after the review, when the Member States formally adopt the report.16 It can change its position on 
recommendations between the review and the final adoption. 
The report of the HRC session where the outcome report was adopted indicates the final number of accepted 
and noted recommendations and records all comments made. It can be a useful advocacy tool.
Since this is a state-led process, NGOs and other stakeholders are not allowed to take the floor during the 
actual review and may only observe. The only opportunity to comment is during the adoptions – and this is 
limited to UN-accredited organizations . 
Nonetheless, you can use the review and its adoption to:
  Conduct last-minute advocacy to follow-up directly or 
through partners to remind recommending States about your key 
recommendations.
  Make the UPR a national moment of awareness and discussion: 
  Alert relevant media to the upcoming review, brief journalists on 
your concerns before the review and encourage them to cover 
them.
  Share information via a press release and/or on social media.
  Seek a meeting with parliamentarians to brief them and encourage 
them to ask questions in parliament, especially about the 
government responses in the review.
  Hold national and/or local public events immediately before the review and invite media.
  Encourage schools or universities to follow the review and discuss it, or to hold a model UPR as 
part of citizenship or human rights education programmes.
  Screen and broadcast the UPR live webcast nationally and/or 
locally: 
  Organize a public screening.
  Invite community-level actors, victim groups, 
parliamentarians and journalists to provide commentary and 
analysis.
  Hold a press conference immediately afterwards.
  If there are safety and security concerns related to organizing 
public screenings, consider requesting UN field presences to 
organize them.
  Raise visibility on any reprisals by the country you are working on 
against journalists and human rights defenders engaging in the UPR 
(with the consent of those targeted) and take added efforts to promote 
the importance and legitimacy of their work. 
  Conduct follow-up advocacy to encourage the country you are 
working on to support key recommendations before the adoption.
16  States usually submit a formal response with their final positions to the HRC, which is posted as an addendum to the outcome 
report. These can be found on the relevant OHCHR UPR country pages, which you can find by clicking on a country’s name on this web -
page: ohchr.org/en/hr-bodies/upr/documentationTOP TIPS
If there are breaking news 
stories that affect human 
rights in your country, suggest  
new recommendations to 
address these.
A short video about your key 
concerns can be a useful tool .  
An example of an Amnesty 
International social media 
video can be viewed here.
TOP TIPS
Reach out  to the 
parliamentary human 
rights committee, if there 
is one, to encourage them 
to provide oversight of the 
government’s engagement 
with the UPR process and 
the implementation of 
recommendations.
During the review, comment  
on social media that tag 
delegates from the country 
you are working on can be 
effective in adding pressure on 
the State delegation. THE UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW (UPR) AND ITS POTENTIAL TO FOSTER FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, 
ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND SAFETY OF JOURNALISTS 14
  Y ou can find a model letter for the State here .
  Y ou can find a model letter for recommending States here .
  Comment and speak out during the adoption of the review: 
  Liaise with local journalists. The commitments made by the country you are working on during 
the process are of public interest and their coverage should be encouraged.
  Issue a press release before and/or after the adoption to comment on the position and responses of 
the country you are working on. 
  Deliver an oral statement (if you have UN accreditation) or find an accredited partner with whom 
you can jointly comment. 
  Share your statement and the recording of it on social media.
4.3 After the review
This last stage covers most of the five-year interval before the country you are working on is reviewed again. 
Towards the end, it will overlap with the first stage, as preparations for the next review begin. 
This is a key stage, as it is when recommendations are 
implemented. Implementation is primarily the responsibility 
of the government, but you can raise pressure for progress, 
including by direct advocacy and campaigning and by 
monitoring and reporting on implementation. Sometimes, 
NGOs act as implementation partners. 
4.3.1 Monitoring UPR implementation 
Civil society monitoring of the implementation of UPR 
commitments enables oversight and continuing pressure 
for progress. It also allows data to be collected for the next 
review. Where needed, also take precautions against any 
reprisals while monitoring and document any that occur 
for possible inclusion (with consent) in the next review. In 
planning your monitoring strategy, consider:
  Budgetary monitoring to verify if the country you are working on is 
allocating enough resources for implementation.
  Using access to information legislation to obtain:
   information about the level of implementation of supported 
recommendations and resources allocated;
  reasons why the country you are working on only noted certain 
recommendations;
  how the country you are working on decided on which 
recommendations to make to other States.
  Documenting any barriers that you faced in accessing information for 
the next review.
  Asking the government, parliament and NMRF to publish annual 
reports on progress and to submit a mid-term report  to the HRC.
  Offering your inputs to the authorities in regard to their progress reports 
and, where accepted, consider making these inputs public along with an 
assessment about whether they were taken into account or not. TRANSLATIONS TOP TIPS
Encourage the State under review to translate 
the outcome report into local languages 
to help local communities understand the 
commitments that have been made and 
participate in the implementation process. 
If the country you are working on does not 
translate the report, consider organizing the 
translation yourself by:
 finding volunteer translators;
 asking donors to provide money for 
translations;
 asking the UNCTs, OHCHR field presence 
or UNESCO field office (if there is one) to 
organize translations. 
TOP TIPS
Foreign policy is public 
policy, and you have the 
right to demand  that the 
government’s human rights-
related decision-making 
in foreign policy is as 
transparent as possible. 
Use  the information you 
collect to publish interim 
reports on progress and 
share them with the 
government, NHRI and 
any NMRF, as well as with 
media organizations, press 
councils, information 
commissions and 
ombudspersons.  GUIDELINES FOR CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS15
4.3.2 Mid-term update 
Halfway through the cycle you can:
  Submit your own mid-term progress report to OHCHR. 
  Make an oral statement during the UPR General Debate (Item 6) at the HRC (if you have UN 
accreditation) to comment on progress and alert other States to your report. 
4.3.3 How to use UPR recommendations in your work
Y ou can refer to UPR commitments by the country on which you are 
working in:
  Relevant debates of the HRC;
  Submissions to UN or regional expert bodies;
  A shadow report (also known as a spotlight report)/SDG scorecard for a country’s Voluntary National Review;
  Advocacy around trade and development aid negotiations. Y ou can ask other States or 
intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) to require implementation of key UPR recommendations to be 
an indicator or a benchmark for progress in negotiations;
  Advocacy with implementing partners including companies and NGOs;
  Advocacy with businesses contributing to human rights violations;
  Relevant human rights court cases you are involved in;
  Election campaigns: 
  Ask candidates to commit to implementing the recommendations you want if they are elected;
  Discussions with parliamentarians;
  Calling for a new or updated National Human Rights Action Plan.17
4.3.4 Use high visibility events as a reminder of commitments 
Consider using World Press Freedom Day  (3 May) and the International 
Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists  (2 November) to 
publicize and remind the government of the recommendations it has committed to implementing. Y ou 
could also use the International Day for Universal Access to Information  (28 September) to comment on the 
level of progress towards implementation of UPR recommendations. 
Use high-level visits by officials from other countries, IGOs or UN human rights mechanisms to ask them to 
raise relevant UPR commitments in their meetings with the government. Y ou could:
  Write an open letter – which could be sent jointly from other organizations or influential individuals – 
to the official before they come.
  Provide an advance briefing to journalists requesting them to ask questions about UPR implementation 
during press conferences.
  Find out if there is any opportunity for you to meet the official so you can tell them what is happening 
in relation to implementation. 
  Use graphic tools developed by UNESCO to help draw attention to freedom of expression, safety of 
journalists and access to information. Y ou will find these in the Resources section.

5. WHY IT MATTERS
Freedom of expression and access to information are fundamental rights enshrined in the UDHR and, 
together with the safety of journalists, are specifically promoted in Agenda 2030’s SDG 16. Y et, there are still 
many places around the world where these rights are denied, obstructed, or limited, which curtails crucial 
participatory citizenship in national affairs. The UPR is an important space for civil society – whether 
individuals, community groups or NGOs – to make linkages between restrictions on freedom of expression 
in a country and the ability of civil society actors to advocate for human rights change. 
Once accepted by governments, UPR recommendations are unique in offering a consensual avenue to 
advancing on human rights commitments. Encouraging reviewing States to make strong and SMART 
recommendations to improve respect for and protection of freedom of expression, including access to 
information and safety of journalists, will contribute towards progress on all human rights goals.
